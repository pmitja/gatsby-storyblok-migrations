He opens with his thoughts on the shortcomings of proprietary software, contrasting that with “good software”, which cares about the end user and thus prioritizes things like privacy, accessibility and openness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drupal is the perfect example of such a technology, largely because of its composable approach which allows both developers and non-technical users to create advanced digital experiences. This is especially strong in the latest version, Drupal 10, which brings numerous benefits to both the developer and editor experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource.com/article/23/4/preserving-open-web-drupal\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Opensource.com: Preserving the open web through Drupal\"><strong>Read more about preserving the open web through Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The evolution of Drupal's composability: from the command line to the browser</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next article from Dries focuses on composability in Drupal and how it has evolved since the first no-code update system, Update Manager, in version 7. One of the first major changes was adopting the use of Composer for managing packages from Symfony, but this was less favored by non-technical users, which led Dries to first conceptualize the Automatic Updates initiative back in 2017.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In combination with the more recent Project Browser initiative, which enables easy installation of modules without using the command line, Automatic Updates gives Drupal users an “app store” like experience. The current plan is for both to be included in core in the second half of the year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dri.es/the-evolution-of-drupal-composability-from-the-command-line-to-the-browser\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries: The evolution of Drupal's composability: from the command line to the browser\"><strong>Read more about Drupal’s composability</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Launching a Next-Drupal site on the Pantheon Platform.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we have an article by <a href=\"https://www.chapterthree.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chapter Three homepage\">Chapter Three</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/flavoflav2000\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"John Faber Twitter\">John Faber</a> which walks the reader through launching a Next-Drupal site on the Pantheon platform. Pantheon is well suited for hosting decoupled websites and offers advantages such as cross-platform tooling and workflows, flexibility with hybrid architecture, and consolidated management for all websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Connecting the Next.js front end to your Pantheon-based site is very straightforward. After setting up the Drupal project, you need to add the Next.js for Pantheon module, install Next.js, create the Next.js site, and then finally update the Next.js URLs on the Drupal side of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.chapterthree.com/blog/launching-a-next-drupal-site-on-pantheon-platform\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chapter Three: Launching a Next-Drupal site on the Pantheon Platform.\"><strong>Read more about launching a Next-Drupal site on Pantheon</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating fields programmatically and not through field configuration</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next article, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmdmatt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matt Glaman Twitter\">Matt Glaman</a> shows how to create Drupal fields programmatically rather than through configuration, since the latter approach relies on nobody modifying the configuration and potentially making changes to your business logic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt first defines and differentiates between base fields and bundle fields before showing the step by step process of defining each of them, with the latter being more complex since bundle fields are available only to specific bundles for an entity type.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also showcases an example of leveraging bundle fields, the Acquia DAM module, where you need a remote asset ID for a DAM asset on the media entity, but it needs to only be available to media types used in the DAM integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://mglaman.dev/blog/creating-fields-programmatically-and-not-through-field-configuration\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matt Glaman: Creating fields programmatically and not through field configuration\"><strong>Read more about programmatically creating fields</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Test your Drupal website with Cypress</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have another article on opensource.com, this one coming from <a href=\"https://atendesigngroup.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Aten Design Group homepage\">Aten Design Group</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jordanlgraham\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jordan Graham Twitter\">Jordan Graham</a> who wrote about testing a Drupal website with the open-source testing tool Cypress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the introduction, Jordan starts by listing the many benefits of using Cypress, such as its extensibility, its ease of use and its growing popularity. The article continues with a section on installing and setting up Cypress, and afterwards a section on writing and running basic tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final section of Jordan’s article covers customizing Cypress for Drupal by writing your own custom Cypress commands, showing an example of a custom command <code>drupalLogout()</code>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource.com/article/23/4/website-test-drupal-cypress\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Opensource.com: Test your Drupal website with Cypress\"><strong>Read more about testing Drupal with Cypress</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why a culture of open-source contribution is good for your business</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue with an article from <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/owenlansbury\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Owen Lansbury drupal.org\">Owen Lansbury</a> of <a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext homepage\">PreviousNext</a> based on his talk at EverythingOpen 2023. This one is less Drupal-specific and more about open source in general, as it is about the value of a culture of open-source contribution and how they approach it at PreviousNext.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Owen’s article first breaks down the specific benefits of contributing to the Drupal or another open-source community: reputation, professional development, and a better employee experience (including better staff retention). In the second half, he then presents their contribution framework, which includes 20% of employees’ time devoted to contributing, as well as more dedicated ‘Hackdays’.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/why-culture-of-open-source-contribution-good-your-business\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext: Why a culture of open-source contribution is good for your business\"><strong>Read more about the value of open-source contribution</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What’s Next for Drupal 10?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Approaching the end of April’s overview, we have an article from <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/catch\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nathaniel Catchpole drupal.org\">Nathaniel Catchpole</a> of <a href=\"https://www.thirdandgrove.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Third and Grove homepage\">Third and Grove</a>, who is a Drupal Core committer, and who takes a look ahead at the upcoming features of the latest major Drupal version, Drupal 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first new feature not included in the final minor version of Drupal 9 is views responsive grid. Features in Drupal 10.1 include better CSS and JavaScript aggregation, constructor property promotion and support for PHP attributes, with work on this version also covering extensively tidying up issue queues. Two of the biggest changes coming later on are the addition of Automatic Updates and Project Browser as experimental core modules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.thirdandgrove.com/insights/whats-next-drupal-10/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Third and Grove: What’s Next for Drupal 10?\"><strong>Read what’s next for Drupal 10</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal recognized as a Digital Public Good</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Last but not least, we have our third and final April article from Dries, this one being the important announcement of Drupal getting officially recognized as a digital public good by the Digital Public Goods Alliance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He starts off with a definition of a (digital) public good, recalling a past article of his about balancing makers and takers in open source, where he already pointed out that open-source software projects should be treated as public goods.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Drupal’s case, this is particularly relevant due to its role in preserving the open web (see the first article in this month’s selection).

          "value": "<p>For over 20 years, Drupal has been a top player in the CMS space, but due to the recent explosion of popular platforms and frameworks, it’s more difficult now to build a team of reliable Drupal developers than it used to be ten or even just five years ago.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, many well-known brands and organizations still rely on Drupal to power their digital experiences, and are looking to not only maintain but advance their Drupal-based websites and apps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It has become especially strong in the enterprise space, where the need for high-level digital experiences is that much greater, but many leading enterprises don’t have in-house Drupal specialists and so need to look for solutions elsewhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The obvious approach is outsourcing Drupal development, preferably in a partnership with a specialized agency as it is able to provide a full Drupal team and/or replacements in the case of any unexpected emergencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we’ll break down the most common cases in which you would want to outsource your Drupal development, and then top things off with some key considerations on what you should be looking for in a Drupal development agency partner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>When to outsource Drupal development</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you need help from external Drupal experts? If you see yourself in one or more of these scenarios, the answer is very likely yes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. You lack an in-house Drupal team&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the most straightforward scenario, most often concerning a digital agency whose client needs Drupal for a project. It’s especially relevant for agencies working with a prestigious client such as a government institution; for example, a <a href=\"/blog/why-creative-agencies-should-partner-development-agency\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Why creative agencies should partner with a development agency\">creative/marketing agency</a> might win a tender for such a client, but the client requires Drupal – what can they do?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Turning down the client would be detrimental to the business and the long-term reputation of their brand, but they typically aren’t able to hire a full internal team of experts quickly enough – and, even if they could, what would they do with them once the only Drupal project they have is complete? Outsourcing takes out the pain in both of these scenarios.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Your in-house Drupal team is spread too thin</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, you may well have a strong in-house team of Drupal developers, but they’re already spread too thin working on current projects to take on a new high-value Drupal project for a potential client, no matter how important this client might be.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Your in-house team is lacking in either the front or the back end</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You or a client might need complex new functionality which requires high-level expertise in both Drupal front-end and back-end development, but your in-house Drupal team lacks the necessary skills in either of these or you only have a few developers available in each.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. You’re using Acquia DXP but want custom features</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>While a SaaS product, Acquia’s Digital Experience Platform is based on the open-source Drupal platform – so, if you need custom functionality, you won’t be able to get them until they’re included in the Acquia platform, unless of course you leverage custom Drupal development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re using Acquia SaaS, chances are high you don’t have the necessary in-house Drupal capacity to roll out custom changes, especially if these are not that frequent, and here Drupal outsourcing is your best bet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. You need work on an outdated version of Drupal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of new developers have never worked with an old version of Drupal such as 6 or 7, and they just generally prefer working with modern, more-developer friendly technologies. So, it’s not unlikely that even Drupal developers with 10+ years of experience will be much more versed in the latest versions than one that was released in 2011.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet Drupal 7 is still the most popular Drupal version, with <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-drupal\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"W3Techs: Usage statistics and market share of Drupal\">around 50% of Drupal websites running on D7</a>. If you need extensive work on a D7 site, either maintenance or an upgrade, outsourcing is the safest and most efficient way to go about it. <a href=\"/d7\" title=\"Agiledrop: Drupal 7 extended support - maintenance for your D7 website\">Learn more about our Drupal 7 extended support offer here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. You need a decoupled/headless Drupal implementation</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the rise in advanced omnichannel digital experiences, decoupled/headless solutions are becoming more and more popular, and Drupal can serve as an especially robust back end for a strong and capable front-end technology such as <a href=\"/blog/decoupling-drupal-react-vue\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Decoupling Drupal: React &amp; Vue\">React or Vue</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might even have in-house JavaScript specialists, but lack the Drupal part of the equation for a certain client/project. If this is your only use case for Drupal, it would make little sense to hire full-time in-house specialists to develop and maintain it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. You run or work for a nonprofit/non-government organization</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Most <a href=\"/blog/why-nonprofits-need-highly-capable-development-partners\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Why nonprofits need highly capable development partners\">nonprofit</a> organizations and NGOs need an enterprise-level platform for their digital experiences, but since they are by definition not for profit, they often lack the budget for a capable SaaS solution like Salesforce, and instead opt for the top choice in the open-source enterprise CMS space, Drupal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1dd6f799-6dc2-4911-80f7-5c7bb5056d1e\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>What to consider when looking for a Drupal development partner</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In this section, we’ll look at some key things to consider when looking for the right Drupal agency to partner with, starting with some general considerations and then moving on with some Drupal-specific ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>General considerations</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>What type of partnership do you want and/or what type of project do you need help with?</strong> Do you need a short or long-term partner? Will the partnership involve multiple projects, one large project, or is it just a one-off custom feature? Do you need new features or just support/maintenance services?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Do you need a full team or only one or two developers?</strong> If you need a full team, how fast can the agency supply it?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>How will the agency’s developers fit into your team?</strong> How can you check their competence and reliability? If the agency is based in a country where English is not the official language, how efficiently will they be able to communicate and collaborate with your team? Is their company culture a good fit with your own culture?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>How will your intellectual property be protected?</strong> Is the agency partner offering white-label services? How do they ensure any confidential information you&nbsp;need to share with them is properly protected?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal-specific considerations</h3>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Are the agency and its developers engaged in the Drupal <a href=\"/blog/category/community\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Community\">community</a>?</strong> Do they participate in and sponsor Drupal events? How much and how often do they contribute to the project? Does their contribution consist simply of code contribution or do they also contribute in other ways, such as organizing courses and other events?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Are they versed in Drupal tooling and best practices?</strong> Do they follow the latest trends and developments of the Drupal project? How do they make sure everyone uses the proper tools and workflows?</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Have they used Drupal on similar projects as the one you need?</strong> Do they have examples of <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/1970744/case-studies\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Case studies from Agiledrop - Your Trusted Drupal Teammates\">case studies</a> and/or references from industries or types of projects that fit your own niche or project? What kind of things have they worked on in this space?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Choosing the right engagement model</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>After finding the right agency, you then need to pick the outsourcing model that best fits your needs. This will depend on the type of project you are working on and <a href=\"/blog/keeping-control-your-project-when-outsourcing-software-development\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Keeping control of your project when outsourcing software development\">how much control you want to keep</a> throughout the development process. In this section, we’ll briefly present some of the most common models of outsourcing and what kind of scenarios they are best suited for.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"/staff-augmentation\" title=\"Agiledrop services: Staff augmentation\">Staff/team augmentation</a>:</strong> this type of outsourcing strategy typically involves only a few people that provide certain skills an in-house team is lacking. This works best when you have an in-house Drupal team, but need just that little bit of additional expertise on either the front or the back end to develop everything properly and promptly.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"/dedicated-development-teams\" title=\"Agiledrop services: Dedicated teams\">Dedicated teams</a>:</strong> here you’re hiring a full team rather than just one or two developers. This approach is ideal for agencies/companies without an in-house Drupal team who still want to be involved in and oversee the development process.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Managed services:</strong> with managed services, you’re leaving both the development and project management to your partner agency. This is the default approach for <a href=\"/fixed-scope-web-development\" title=\"Agiledrop services: Fixed scope web development projects\">turnkey/fixed scope projects</a>, often utilized by government agencies and nonprofit organizations.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Outsourcing Drupal development to a specialized agency is often the safest bet with such a long-standing platform, especially if your situation falls into one of the seven scenarios we outlined above.

This works best when you have an in-house Drupal team, but need just that little bit of additional expertise on either the front or the back end to develop everything properly and promptly.</li>\n\t<li><strong><a href=\"/dedicated-development-teams\" title=\"Agiledrop services: Dedicated teams\">Dedicated teams</a>:</strong> here you’re hiring a full team rather than just one or two developers. This approach is ideal for agencies/companies without an in-house Drupal team who still want to be involved in and oversee the development process.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Managed services:</strong> with managed services, you’re leaving both the development and project management to your partner agency. This is the default approach for <a href=\"/fixed-scope-web-development\" title=\"Agiledrop services: Fixed scope web development projects\">turnkey/fixed scope projects</a>, often utilized by government agencies and nonprofit organizations.</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n\n<p>Outsourcing Drupal development to a specialized agency is often the safest bet with such a long-standing platform, especially if your situation falls into one of the seven scenarios we outlined above.

We hope you enjoy this month’s selection!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Getting Single Directory Components in Drupal Core</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, we have an article by <a href=\"https://www.lullabot.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lullabot homepage\">Lullabot</a>’s ​​<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/e0ipso\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mateu Aguiló Bosch drupal.org\">Mateu Aguiló Bosch</a> detailing the work being done on Single Directory Components in Drupal. He begins with the goals of the project and an overview of UI Patterns, a predecessor of SDC, before moving on to the team’s core architectural decisions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These six principles are: all component code is in one directory; components are YML plugins; auto-generated libraries; the component API needs to be descriptive; components are embedded with native Twig tools; and they are replaceable. Mateu also provides an example of working with SDC before concluding with some next steps, key here being the proposal to include SDC in Drupal Core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lullabot.com/articles/getting-single-directory-components-drupal-core\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lullabot: Getting Single Directory Components in Drupal Core\"><strong>Read more about SDC in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Creating Your First Single Directory Component within Drupal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the same line, we have another article on single directory components, this one coming from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeherchel\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mike Herchel Twitter\">Mike Herchel</a> and providing a step-by-step guide on how to create a single directory component in Drupal. Specifically, he shows how to migrate the “tabs” component in the new front-end theme Olivero to SDC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the guide, Mike also includes a bit of background on the work done on single directory components, basically recapping the above post from Mateu and including links to the most relevant drupal.org issues for SDC. He finishes with a call on community members to help out and a few steps on how they can do so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://herchel.com/articles/creating-your-first-single-directory-component-within-drupal\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Herchel: Creating Your First Single Directory Component within Drupal\"><strong>Read more about creating a SDC in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why content management systems can outperform static site generators</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The third article comes from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dries\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries Buytaert Twitter\">Dries</a>, who wrote about how content management systems can outperform static site generators and why he is sticking with Drupal for his blog (besides being the project founder and lead, of course).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His key reason for preferring Drupal is the slow and unoptimized publishing workflow of leading SSGs, whereas Drupal makes authoring very user friendly. He also busts the myth of SSGs offering faster website performance by comparing the page load times of websites built on different platforms. Still, he points out that he sees the value of static assets, but just prefers the superior authoring experience provided by a CMS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dri.es/why-content-management-systems-can-outperform-static-site-generators\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries: Why content management systems can outperform static site generators\"><strong>Read more about CMS vs. SSG</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Upgrading your site to Drupal 10</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we have an article by <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/fenstrat\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Saul Willers drupal.org\">Saul Willers</a> of <a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext homepage\">PreviousNext</a> about upgrading from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10. The main changes to keep top of mind here are updated platform requirements (PHP 8.1+) and third-party dependencies (e.g. Symfony 6).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To prepare for the upgrade, make sure your website is running on the latest version of Drupal 9, namely 9.5, and update all contributed modules that have Drupal 10 ready versions available (for custom modules, you’ll need custom development – use Upgrade Status to catch deprecations). Lastly, you need to upgrade to CKEditor 5, and then you can smoothly upgrade to Drupal 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/upgrading-your-site-drupal-10\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext: Upgrading your site to Drupal 10\"><strong>Read more about upgrading from Drupal 9 to 10</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exploring Decoupled/Headless Drupal distributions while building the Schema.org Blueprints demo</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have an article from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jrockowitz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jacob Rockowitz Twitter\">Jacob Rockowitz</a>, the creator of the Schema.org Drupal module. In it, he shares his research on two popular headless/decoupled Drupal distributions and how it has helped him in the creation of the Schema.org Blueprints module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first distribution which Jacob looks at is Contenta, released in 2017 and focusing largely on content as its name suggests. The second one is Acquia CMS, an open-source Drupal based CMS optimized for the Acquia platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Jacob highlights, both of these have been vital to developing the headless ecosystem of Drupal, and he is looking forward to seeing how it will progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/schemadotorg-demo-distributions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jacob Rockowitz: Exploring Decoupled/Headless Drupal distributions while building the Schema.org Blueprints demo\"><strong>Read more about two key headless Drupal distributions</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal Premium Features module now stable</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next article from March, <a href=\"https://ckeditor.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CKEditor homepage\">CKEditor</a>’s <a href=\"https://ckeditor.com/blog/authors/gokce-tosun/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gökçe Tosun CKEditor\">Gökçe Tosun</a> presents the CKEditor 5 Premium Features module for Drupal which is production ready as of last month. CKEditor 5 is already the default Drupal editor since Drupal 10, and this module provides exclusive additional functionality to the editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The module’s features are divided into two groups: the collaborative features include comment threads, tracking changes, revision history, real-time collaboration, and notifications, while the productive features cover two converter plugins – exporting to PDF &amp; Word and importing from Word – and mentions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ckeditor.com/blog/drupal-premium-features-module/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CKEditor: Drupal Premium Features module now stable\"><strong>Read more about the CKEditor 5 Premium Features module</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>High concurrency Composer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue with an interesting post by <a href=\"https://www.acquia.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Acquia homepage\">Acquia</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wimleers\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wim Leers Twitter\">Wim Leers</a> about a bug in the package_manager module, which is the basis for two of Drupal’s key strategic initiatives, Automatic Updates &amp; Project Browser. Namely, the issue was a random test failure on DrupalCI, for which the failure was increasing over time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The team was able to determine that the problem was with Composer, which led to the discovery of the root cause of the bug: using Composer in a high concurrency context can cause two different commands to be executed on the same millisecond.

We hope you enjoy this month’s selection!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Getting Single Directory Components in Drupal Core</h3>\n\n<p>For starters, we have an article by <a href=\"https://www.lullabot.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lullabot homepage\">Lullabot</a>’s ​​<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/e0ipso\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mateu Aguiló Bosch drupal.org\">Mateu Aguiló Bosch</a> detailing the work being done on Single Directory Components in Drupal. He begins with the goals of the project and an overview of UI Patterns, a predecessor of SDC, before moving on to the team’s core architectural decisions.</p>\n\n<p>These six principles are: all component code is in one directory; components are YML plugins; auto-generated libraries; the component API needs to be descriptive; components are embedded with native Twig tools; and they are replaceable. Mateu also provides an example of working with SDC before concluding with some next steps, key here being the proposal to include SDC in Drupal Core.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lullabot.com/articles/getting-single-directory-components-drupal-core\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lullabot: Getting Single Directory Components in Drupal Core\"><strong>Read more about SDC in Drupal</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Creating Your First Single Directory Component within Drupal</h3>\n\n<p>In the same line, we have another article on single directory components, this one coming from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeherchel\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mike Herchel Twitter\">Mike Herchel</a> and providing a step-by-step guide on how to create a single directory component in Drupal. Specifically, he shows how to migrate the “tabs” component in the new front-end theme Olivero to SDC.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to the guide, Mike also includes a bit of background on the work done on single directory components, basically recapping the above post from Mateu and including links to the most relevant drupal.org issues for SDC. He finishes with a call on community members to help out and a few steps on how they can do so.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://herchel.com/articles/creating-your-first-single-directory-component-within-drupal\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Herchel: Creating Your First Single Directory Component within Drupal\"><strong>Read more about creating a SDC in Drupal</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Why content management systems can outperform static site generators</h3>\n\n<p>The third article comes from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dries\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries Buytaert Twitter\">Dries</a>, who wrote about how content management systems can outperform static site generators and why he is sticking with Drupal for his blog (besides being the project founder and lead, of course).</p>\n\n<p>His key reason for preferring Drupal is the slow and unoptimized publishing workflow of leading SSGs, whereas Drupal makes authoring very user friendly. He also busts the myth of SSGs offering faster website performance by comparing the page load times of websites built on different platforms. Still, he points out that he sees the value of static assets, but just prefers the superior authoring experience provided by a CMS.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dri.es/why-content-management-systems-can-outperform-static-site-generators\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries: Why content management systems can outperform static site generators\"><strong>Read more about CMS vs. SSG</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Upgrading your site to Drupal 10</h3>\n\n<p>Next up, we have an article by <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/fenstrat\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Saul Willers drupal.org\">Saul Willers</a> of <a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext homepage\">PreviousNext</a> about upgrading from Drupal 9 to Drupal 10. The main changes to keep top of mind here are updated platform requirements (PHP 8.1+) and third-party dependencies (e.g. Symfony 6).</p>\n\n<p>To prepare for the upgrade, make sure your website is running on the latest version of Drupal 9, namely 9.5, and update all contributed modules that have Drupal 10 ready versions available (for custom modules, you’ll need custom development – use Upgrade Status to catch deprecations). Lastly, you need to upgrade to CKEditor 5, and then you can smoothly upgrade to Drupal 10.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/upgrading-your-site-drupal-10\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext: Upgrading your site to Drupal 10\"><strong>Read more about upgrading from Drupal 9 to 10</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Exploring Decoupled/Headless Drupal distributions while building the Schema.org Blueprints demo</h3>\n\n<p>Moving on, we have an article from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jrockowitz\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jacob Rockowitz Twitter\">Jacob Rockowitz</a>, the creator of the Schema.org Drupal module. In it, he shares his research on two popular headless/decoupled Drupal distributions and how it has helped him in the creation of the Schema.org Blueprints module.</p>\n\n<p>The first distribution which Jacob looks at is Contenta, released in 2017 and focusing largely on content as its name suggests. The second one is Acquia CMS, an open-source Drupal based CMS optimized for the Acquia platform.</p>\n\n<p>As Jacob highlights, both of these have been vital to developing the headless ecosystem of Drupal, and he is looking forward to seeing how it will progress.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/schemadotorg-demo-distributions\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jacob Rockowitz: Exploring Decoupled/Headless Drupal distributions while building the Schema.org Blueprints demo\"><strong>Read more about two key headless Drupal distributions</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Drupal Premium Features module now stable</h3>\n\n<p>In the next article from March, <a href=\"https://ckeditor.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CKEditor homepage\">CKEditor</a>’s <a href=\"https://ckeditor.com/blog/authors/gokce-tosun/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gökçe Tosun CKEditor\">Gökçe Tosun</a> presents the CKEditor 5 Premium Features module for Drupal which is production ready as of last month. CKEditor 5 is already the default Drupal editor since Drupal 10, and this module provides exclusive additional functionality to the editor.</p>\n\n<p>The module’s features are divided into two groups: the collaborative features include comment threads, tracking changes, revision history, real-time collaboration, and notifications, while the productive features cover two converter plugins – exporting to PDF &amp; Word and importing from Word – and mentions. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ckeditor.com/blog/drupal-premium-features-module/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CKEditor: Drupal Premium Features module now stable\"><strong>Read more about the CKEditor 5 Premium Features module</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>High concurrency Composer</h3>\n\n<p>We continue with an interesting post by <a href=\"https://www.acquia.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Acquia homepage\">Acquia</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/wimleers\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wim Leers Twitter\">Wim Leers</a> about a bug in the package_manager module, which is the basis for two of Drupal’s key strategic initiatives, Automatic Updates &amp; Project Browser. Namely, the issue was a random test failure on DrupalCI, for which the failure was increasing over time. </p>\n\n<p>The team was able to determine that the problem was with Composer, which led to the discovery of the root cause of the bug: using Composer in a high concurrency context can cause two different commands to be executed on the same millisecond. The solution ended up being a simple one-line fix which allows to avoid any such collisions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wimleers.com/blog/high-concurrency-composer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Wim Leers: High concurrency Composer\"><strong>Read more about high concurrency Composer</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Drupal 10 - Don't Panic!</h3>\n\n<p>We’re concluding this month’s overview with another Drupal 10 article, written by <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/dunx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Duncan Worrell drupal.org\">Duncan Worrell</a> of <a href=\"https://www.cyber-duck.co.uk\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cyber-Duck homepage\">Cyber-Duck</a>.

Here are five telltale signs to look out for as well as how you can improve going forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reduced traffic on your website</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You see increased traffic on your website when your digital marketing strategy is working. If you see a decline in the numbers, especially at an alarming rate, it is clear that you need to do something. One of the reasons this could be happening is that you are not receiving enough visibility. Your website could probably be ranking at the bottom of the search engines. If this is the case, you need to reevaluate your SEO strategy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At this juncture, it is not the time to go at it alone. Make sure to seek expert advice. Working with a reliable <a href=\"https://seotactica.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Tactica homepage\">digital marketing agency</a> can help you diagnose your SEO strategy and find a cure. The experts can help you create a good strategy that works for your business so you can start seeing more traffic your website’s way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Increased bounce rate</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your website could be receiving good traffic, but the visitors are bouncing off at a rather high rate. This means that people visiting your website leave without doing anything else such as clicking another page. A possible reason for this could be poor website user experience. The pages of your website could be taking too long to load.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, people aren’t that patient. They are highly likely to bounce if they have to wait for minutes, or even seconds, for a page to load. In addition, the landing page of your website could be too confusing, making it difficult to navigate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What can you do to improve? Work with your web design and web development teams to create a pain-free experience for users. Focus on speeding up load time and creating a clear design that isn’t confusing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Fewer conversions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Are your website visitors converting to customers as per your goals? Your digital marketing strategy shouldn’t just lead to increased website traffic. It should also ensure that the leads are converting to customers. Otherwise, you risk your business dwindling due to reduced sales. Some of the reasons why leads aren’t converting include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Targeting the wrong audience that isn’t relevant to your business</li>\r\n\t<li>Poor ad targeting</li>\r\n\t<li>Changes to your website design</li>\r\n\t<li>Poor user experience</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Start by determining your ideal customer and then change your targeting to the right audience. If you have recently made changes to your website, do an analysis to determine the ones that might not be well received. You can consider going back to an earlier design to see if it makes a difference. Again, work on improving the website user experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lack of engagement</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Customer engagement is critical in <a href=\"https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/16017-build-customer-loyalty.html\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Business News Daily: 7 Ways to Build Customer Loyalty\">building a loyal customer base</a>. It is through engaging with customers on various digital platforms that businesses get opportunities to build meaningful relationships that bring business benefits. If your online audience isn’t showing any interest in engaging with your brand, it is time to restrategize.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For starters, start creating engaging content that encourages your audience to ask questions, leave comments, and share. This could include creating keyword-optimized posts, running contests, and including engaging videos and images. In addition, your digital marketing strategy should include responding to comments and answering questions to keep the conversations going.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strategies like <a href=\"/blog/orm-digital-marketing-how-it-helps-build-better-relationship-your-customers\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: ORM in digital marketing: How it helps build a better relationship with your customers\">online reputation management</a> are also important to create a better connection with your customer base. These strategies allow customers to interact with your brand and leave feedback, which can be used to strengthen the relationship between your business and its customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Reduced or no ad clicks</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Any business would want to see more people clicking through campaign ads. At the end of the day, you want a <a href=\"https://smartblogger.com/marketing-campaign/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Smart Blogger: 20+ Successful Marketing Campaign Examples That’ll Inspire You\">successful campaign</a> that can lead to increased sales. If you see low clicks it could be a sign that something isn’t working as it should. This could be because your ad content is not resonating with your audience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than selling features of your product, consider selling value. Start telling people how your product can help them solve their problems. In addition, include search keywords in your ad text to increase visibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is important to keep an eye on your digital marketing strategy to ensure that it keeps delivering results over time. However, if you notice reduced traffic, low conversion rate, high bounce rate, no ad clicks, and lack of engagement, it is clear that the strategy isn’t as effective. In such cases, get to the root cause and find ways to improve.

This time we spoke with <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/domidc\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dominique De Cooman drupal.org\">Dominique De Cooman</a>, CTO &amp; co-founder of the Belgian <a href=\"https://dropsolid.com/en\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dropsolid homepage\">digital experience agency</a> and <a href=\"https://dropsolid.io\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dropsolid Experience Cloud homepage\">digital experience cloud</a> Dropsolid about how they contribute to the Drupal community and what Drupal should be focusing on moving forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>1. Please tell us a little about yourself and Dropsolid. How do you participate in the Drupal community and what do you do professionally?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I am the CTO &amp; co-founder of Dropsolid. Professionally the CTO role here at Dropsolid is a business role that connects the business side of the customer suite and the technical side. From that role we design the services we offer to customers and the products we offer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the community, we are most active on the Drupal front and the Mautic front. Obviously, our infrastructure team also tries to contribute to all the infrastructure tooling we are using.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dropsolid has 2 business units; one is the digital experience agency which delivers services to build great digital experience, all the way from strategy, development, maintenance, UX/UI, everything you need to build a great digital experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then the Dropsolid Experience Cloud is a product Dropsolid puts into the market, that’s a suite of products – a DXP, as it is called by Gartner, which unifies content management, marketing automation, CDP and Drupal cloud tools to make it easy to develop, and it also works for Mautic to develop on Mautic as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. What is your most memorable experience from the Drupal community?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dropsolid is a sponsor of DrupalCon Europe, we’ve been a diamond sponsor since 2019, in Amsterdam. For me that was a dream come true.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember my first DrupalCon when I went to Munich. I had already been working with Drupal for 5 years but had never been to a DrupalCon, but after feeling the vibe of the DrupalCon and everything, I decided, wow, okay, I really have to try and create a company, an idea which Steven and I already had. So that’s how Dropsolid was born 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. What are some of Dropsolid’s contributions to Drupal and its community that you’re most proud of?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to our Experience Cloud, we have a distribution called <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/dropsolid_rocketship\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dropsolid Rocketship drupal.org\">Dropsolid Rocketship</a> which is on drupal.org. It’s a collaboration between the product team and the agency team. So, what we try to accomplish with Rocketship is to create factory elements, where you as an agency can reuse components and try to make it as composable as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can build sites more quickly, which means that as an agency you have a competitive advantage over other agencies who don’t use such things – although, they can just download our starter kit, our distribution on drupal.org and use it as well. But obviously, knowing how to work with it is also an advantage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, there’s the factory element, and then there’s the experience element. What we try to do here at Dropsolid, is we try to focus on the editor experience. That’s why we chose to do a lot of work on Layout Builder, and we contributed a lot through our distribution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Layout Builder is a module in Drupal that allows you to create layouts, which makes it basically very easy for content editors to compose pages using drag and drop and apply the concept of composable content and use reusable content blocks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s like the next iteration on the Paragraphs module; Layout Builder takes it a step further by applying the inside out principle, where really, what you see is what you get.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then on the other hand we also try to focus on the end user experience. We still consider ourselves a small enterprise, so we try to use as much work of others when we contribute, we don’t try to invent our own things, we’re just trying to build on top of things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve also been working on a headless starter kit. And that’s already there, we’ve used a lot of work that has been done by Chapter Three, who have Next-Drupal, which is Next.js with Drupal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We haven’t contributed yet, it’s still in the development phase; but the goal is to make it work with Layout Builder, so you have your layout builder content editor experience and that just works out of the box with the Next.js front end. So if you change a layout, you don’t have to do extra front-end development to make that work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. How do you see Drupal’s position in the current and future digital experience landscape?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Dropsolid is especially active in the mid market. Here you see a lot of competition these days from SaaS headless CMSs, which offers exactly this capability – a really beautiful content editor interface and a really fast and SEO-friendly, very performant and good-looking JavaScript interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, for us, it’s also a commercial need, but I think if Drupal can get this out of the box, that would be a huge blessing for all the small and mid-size enterprise customers a lot of agencies have that require much more out of the box, and need to compete with companies like Kentico and Storyblok.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even WordPress is pretty strong these days. It’s still not Drupal, but customers are really impressed with some of the experiences it can deliver.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, in a lower enterprise market, I think that’s something Drupal needs to have and that’s where we as Dropsolid are focusing on, to try to get it to that next level. One of my other dreams is that one day we will be able to afford a full-time core contributor, who can build both on Drupal and Mautic.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think there is a great opportunity here for the Drupal community to move closer to the marketing community. If we can better understand what marketers value, what content editors value, I think that will be a huge win.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because they’re actually the ones who are building the digital experiences these days. A lot of site builders are also marketers. A lot of these site builders not only build with Drupal, build the pages, build the experiences, build the customer journeys, they also have to work with the marketing automation tooling. So, they’re actually the same user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I see that with a lot of customers, but we also see this internally – our marketing team consists of only two people, Els and Leen, who do a huge amount of work putting our two brands in the market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They’re using Drupal and Mautic to do their job every day. And they said to us, look, we need good tools, we need to be able to work quickly, we need to be able to focus on our content, on our campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The tools can’t be an obstruction, the better the user experience is, the quicker we can work and the more value we can deliver for the company. This is also a reason why we thought it’s a really smart move to invest in Layout Builder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then the huge opportunity is to bring the Mautic and the Drupal communities closer together. I think they can learn a lot from each other. The Drupal community is notoriously very strong at contribution and at deep technical knowledge, with really strong developers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If that power can be brought to the Mautic community, that would be incredible for a product like Mautic which is in my eyes still a young product, but has a lot of traction and is growing very fast. But five years ago it didn’t even exist, so it’s growing a lot faster, while Drupal is actually declining if you look at the sheer numbers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the sites that are built on Drupal are a lot bigger and make a lot more impact, so if we could measure the impact Drupal is making, it would also be growing, but in sheer numbers, it’s declining. And that’s the trend because a lot of Drupal 7 sites were built for SMBs. All these sites are not being renewed into Drupal 9, 10 sites, so that’s declining, and Mautic is growing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I think that momentum Mautic has, as well as the understanding of what is important for the people who are working with these tools, i.e. the marketers, the content editors, is something that would be very beneficial for the Drupal community, if these two communities start learning from each other.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because then we’re touching the subject of the open DXP; once you have Mautic and Drupal, you almost have the open DXP. If you add for example Apache Unomi, the open customer data platform, you basically have an open DXP.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where I think if Drupal and Mautic and all these communities can bring their strengths together, it can be a really killer product, especially because it’s open and it can still be delivered at a fair price, and the marketers and the developers are still in control of the solution.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I feel that this resonates in the market; even yesterday I had a talk with a marketing digital director of a large employer organization here in Belgium with more than 100,000 employers who are members. I’ve known him for quite some time and he’s really a fan of Drupal and of open source.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when he learned of Mautic and also about Unomi, that really excited him. “Oh, I can have this in my marketing stack as well, the same principles I have in Drupal?” I said, yes, and you’re in total control, the code is yours, the data is yours, everything is yours, you can develop on top of it, there are companies that can give you a managed service on this, that can give you a platform to work on. But you will still be the owner of all these things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, I see it excites a lot of people in the marketing space as well, and I think it could also bring an innovation momentum because there are a lot of challenges that need to be solved on the Mautic level as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we see that also tied to us being a business and running into these issues offering Drupal to the market; I would hate to see Drupal just only be a high-end enterprise solution. It has so much value under the hood, and it only needs the right kind of packaging to stay very relevant to medium and smaller enterprises.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think for SMBs, it will be very difficult because the competition is very strong there. But in the smaller and medium enterprise space, if Drupal gets the out of the box thing right with a great content experience and the great end user experience, that will be awesome. And I think it will be a difficult value proposition to challenge by proprietary systems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. What do you think the Drupal community’s priorities and goals should be moving forward?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re seeing Drupal becoming a really mature product; Dries also presented this in his latest Driesnote, where he said that we had to do a lot of things under the water line, but now we are past Drupal 8 and now with Drupal 9 and 10, the platform will once again be easier to use now the groundwork has been done. We can really focus on making Drupal easier to use, and I think that’s true.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the really big challenges, moving 7 to 8, I don’t know how we did it, but somehow it happened, moving from the old codebase from Drupal 7 to the new Symfony framework, it’s huge, but you can see this effort I think would also have to be made on Mautic and you need really strong developers and contributors to pull this off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the beginning, as a developer, I was more focused on code, trying to get code there and trying to get the people here to develop. But as I move more and more into a business-oriented role, I saw that actually, planting the right ideas is also very important; planting the right ideas in people’s minds and trying to shine a light on certain areas that need to be illuminated because they’re important.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also try to speak at conferences and motivate everyone here in the company to do the same thing. We have a lot of people who have presented at DrupalCon – not only developers, but for example our account managers and service delivery managers who are not technical at all are also presenting at DrupalCon.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think getting voices outside of the developer sphere into the Drupal community is super important to create the awareness of the business reality that Drupal is functioning in. It’s not just about the code, it also needs to be relevant for people to stay on board, and I think it’s very important to get non-technical people into the Drupal community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Besides Drupal and Mautic, what are you most excited about in the technology space this year?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s something that we’ve already been thinking about a lot, but now it’s really in the media, it’s in everybody’s face with the whole AI revolution. Actually, Dropsolid recently got a really nice government grant from the Flemish government and we’ve built a whole AI clustering and classification algorithm on Apache Unomi to automatically create segments on data.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the AI we used is a service that has been provided by the Google Cloud, it’s like a microservice you can use to set up your data pipelines and the whole thing, and it operates in the cloud.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for me, that’s the only thing that is still not sovereign. Dropsolid’s product vision is to become the most open DXP with a low-entry barrier, and with a great experience for the content editors and the end users. But, to be the most open, I think, to do that, the entire platform has to be sovereign.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You need to be able to take all the components, and if the customer says, okay, here are my resources, here is my Kubernetes cluster, you need to be able to deploy it for them on their cluster and manage it for them so the whole thing is completely sovereign.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And the difficult part is to do that with data and with AI. That’s something I’ve been figuring out. I think it will be possible to do it, to also have the AI and the data part sovereign. It already works, because you can do it with Drupal, with Mautic, with Unomi – it can be done, that’s something that we’re already doing with customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then you have the whole management layer on top of it, that’s still our product, that’s still SaaS. But the AI and the data component, we still use a microservice in the cloud. So to do that sovereign with the resources of the customer, I think that’s probably still a couple of years ahead business-wise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it can go fast. If you look at how quickly the world is taken with the whole ChatGPT thing, everybody knows about it, so everybody’s being educated by these smart chatbots. And then I think a couple of years down the road we will start to realize that these powerful things are actually running somewhere where we don’t see the code, we don’t control the infrastructure, we don’t control what is being put into that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think a lot of organizations will think, okay, we don’t want that. If we want to use this, we want to have it close to us. This powerful thing, we need to have it really close to what we are doing; it will not be relevant for everyone, but it definitely fits into our vision of being the most open DXP, so, yeah the data and AI stuff is the next step. That excites me, and I think it’s going faster than I anticipated.</p>\r\n",

And then I think a couple of years down the road we will start to realize that these powerful things are actually running somewhere where we don’t see the code, we don’t control the infrastructure, we don’t control what is being put into that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I think a lot of organizations will think, okay, we don’t want that. If we want to use this, we want to have it close to us. This powerful thing, we need to have it really close to what we are doing; it will not be relevant for everyone, but it definitely fits into our vision of being the most open DXP, so, yeah the data and AI stuff is the next step. That excites me, and I think it’s going faster than I anticipated.</p>\n",

At first we all thought that this was just a temporary measure, but as soon as it started to become apparent that it was to be much more permanent, companies started to make adjustments in order to make this work long-term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What many businesses ultimately settled on was a hybrid work model which combines remote and in-office work. Of course, this comes with its own set of <a href=\"/blog/6-challenges-hybrid-work-and-how-overcome-them\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 6 challenges of hybrid work and how to overcome them\">challenges</a> which require the company culture to be even stronger and more <a href=\"/blog/5-key-considerations-successful-hybrid-work\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 5 key considerations for successful hybrid work\">people-focused</a>. It now needs to be even more clearly defined and promoted, so that the employees working remotely are also able to experience it properly and feel like they belong to the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Competition for top talent</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another compelling reason for developing and nurturing a strong human-centered company culture is the high demand for top talent which is particularly seen in the tech industry.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With such an abundance of choice, a lot of sought-after professionals consider more than just the salary and other financial perks of a job. A healthy, well communicated, employee-focused company culture will be essential to <a href=\"/blog/how-attract-retain-top-tech-talent-2022\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How to attract &amp; retain top tech talent in 2022\">attracting and retaining</a> these individuals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Rise in new, unfamiliar technologies</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The core tenet of the digital age is the unprecedented technological innovation, giving rise to a plethora of new technologies that require a different mindset and novel skills to be fully leveraged.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/blog/learning-core-value-agiledrop\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Learning as a core value at Agiledrop\">A company culture focused on learning</a> and professional development will make it easier for people to acquire new skills which are necessary to grow and progress in such an environment. Well structured onboarding and upskilling resources have become more than just nice-to-haves and are now essential elements of a strong, forward-looking culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Stress and uncertainty that come with change</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>All of this change that comes with digitalization – and just society in general right now – is connected with a lot of uncertainty that leads to stress, whether conscious or unconscious. And it’s really no surprise at a time of disruptions such as the growing economic crisis and the rise of generative AI which is sure to completely disrupt work as we know it, causing even more fear about the uncertainty of the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To help mitigate this stress and prevent your employees from burning out, your company culture should be employee-centric and include accessible ways of boosting team spirit and promoting connection between teammates. As so many of us have witnessed during the past few years, even just connecting online can be invaluable during such times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Change management</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Particularly due to the above two points, a strong company culture should be optimized for change management. Change inevitably brings about <a href=\"/podcast/howard-tiersky-overcoming-resistance-change-successful-digital-transformation\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Howard Tiersky - Overcoming resistance to change for successful digital transformation\">resistance to change</a>, and if you give in to it, you’re sure to start lagging behind the competitors who <em>are</em> embracing change by helping their employees do so.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, the better your company is at change management, the better your chances of unlocking the opportunities that arise with all this change rather than getting dragged behind by the challenges it poses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Tips for a strong company culture</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>So, now that you’re keenly aware of the reasons for a strong company culture, how can you actually go about strengthening it? Here are 5 tips to follow.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Leadership should drive and exhibit culture.</strong> Culture is something that needs to be fostered top-down rather than bottom-up; of course small changes can happen in the opposite direction, but it’s unlikely that major ones get introduced without dedicated involvement from leadership.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Hire for culture fit.</strong> With the abundance of knowledge and learning resources, upskilling and reskilling have become a lot easier – if not necessary, as we’ve alluded to earlier with regards to new technologies and adjacent skills. So, adapt your hiring practices to focus more on culture fit rather than strictly technical expertise; that’s not to say you should completely ignore candidates’ competencies, just keep in mind that someone who is a poor culture fit is likely to cause more trouble than they’re worth, regardless of their proficiency.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Clearly define your mission, vision and values.</strong> It’s very difficult to create and nurture a healthy company culture if you don’t know what that culture is even based on.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Prioritize and promote <a href=\"/blog/achieving-healthy-work-life-balance-digital-agency\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Achieving a healthy work-life balance at a digital agency\">work-life balance</a>.</strong> This has become even more important with the surge in remote and hybrid work, as the line between work and personal life can often become blurred when working from home. A healthy work-life balance is one of the best defenses against burnout and a key element of employee well being.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Have a system for collecting (anonymous) feedback.</strong> This demonstrates both openness and a willingness to adapt to the needs of employees if needed. Make sure to respect people’s anonymity, as the option of giving feedback anonymously makes such feedback much more likely to happen – and to be honest.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Your employees are your most important stakeholders, as they’re the ones creating customer-facing experiences and interacting with customers. Taking care to have your company culture be people-focused and value-based will thus translate into better customer-facing experiences and a more sustainable business.</p>\r\n",

Change inevitably brings about <a href=\"/podcast/howard-tiersky-overcoming-resistance-change-successful-digital-transformation\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Howard Tiersky - Overcoming resistance to change for successful digital transformation\">resistance to change</a>, and if you give in to it, you’re sure to start lagging behind the competitors who <em>are</em> embracing change by helping their employees do so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, the better your company is at change management, the better your chances of unlocking the opportunities that arise with all this change rather than getting dragged behind by the challenges it poses.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Tips for a strong company culture</h2>\n\n<p>So, now that you’re keenly aware of the reasons for a strong company culture, how can you actually go about strengthening it? Here are 5 tips to follow.</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>Leadership should drive and exhibit culture.</strong> Culture is something that needs to be fostered top-down rather than bottom-up; of course small changes can happen in the opposite direction, but it’s unlikely that major ones get introduced without dedicated involvement from leadership.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Hire for culture fit.</strong> With the abundance of knowledge and learning resources, upskilling and reskilling have become a lot easier – if not necessary, as we’ve alluded to earlier with regards to new technologies and adjacent skills. So, adapt your hiring practices to focus more on culture fit rather than strictly technical expertise; that’s not to say you should completely ignore candidates’ competencies, just keep in mind that someone who is a poor culture fit is likely to cause more trouble than they’re worth, regardless of their proficiency.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Clearly define your mission, vision and values.</strong> It’s very difficult to create and nurture a healthy company culture if you don’t know what that culture is even based on.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Prioritize and promote <a href=\"/blog/achieving-healthy-work-life-balance-digital-agency\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Achieving a healthy work-life balance at a digital agency\">work-life balance</a>.</strong> This has become even more important with the surge in remote and hybrid work, as the line between work and personal life can often become blurred when working from home. A healthy work-life balance is one of the best defenses against burnout and a key element of employee well being.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Have a system for collecting (anonymous) feedback.</strong> This demonstrates both openness and a willingness to adapt to the needs of employees if needed. Make sure to respect people’s anonymity, as the option of giving feedback anonymously makes such feedback much more likely to happen – and to be honest.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\n\n<p>Your employees are your most important stakeholders, as they’re the ones creating customer-facing experiences and interacting with customers. Taking care to have your company culture be people-focused and value-based will thus translate into better customer-facing experiences and a more sustainable business.</p>\n",

Check out what we read in February.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Rise of OpenAI and ChatGPT</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re kicking off this month’s list with an article that’s not exclusively focused on Drupal, but nevertheless covers a topic so important that it definitely deserved a spot: the rise of generative artificial intelligence, namely, OpenAI and ChatGPT.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.velir.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Velir homepage\">Velir</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinquillen\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kevin Quillen Twitter\">Kevin Quillen</a>, author of the article, first tells the reader more about OpenAI and what kind of projects their AI powers before diving into the specifics of integrating OpenAI with Drupal via its API.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kevin breaks down 5 features of using OpenAI in Drupal: prompt/text generation explorer; content generation; integration with the CKEditor; log analysis; and text embedding. He also lists some features that are currently still in development and are likely to be available in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.velir.com/ideas/2023/02/16/the-rise-of-openai-and-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Velir: The Rise of OpenAI and ChatGPT\"><strong>Read more about using OpenAI in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Artificial Intelligence, the future of Content Management and the Web</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s continue in the same context, with an article by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dries\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries Buytaert Twitter\">Dries</a> about AI and its impact on content management and the web as a whole, which also references the above article by Kevin by showcasing some example features of his OpenAI-Drupal integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most notable impacts of artificial intelligence which Dries highlights is its disintermediation of traditional search engines, an important step in what he calls the “Big Reverse of the Web”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the impact and use in content management, the article also talks about the current and future usage of AI in software development, before finishing with some challenges and concerns of generative AI such as legal/copyright issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dri.es/artificial-intelligence-the-future-of-content-management-and-the-web\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries: Artificial Intelligence, the future of Content Management and the Web\"><strong>Read Dries’s thoughts on AI and its impact on the web</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Upgrading to Drupal 10 (And Beyond) With Composer</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, for the first Drupal-specific article in this month’s selection, we have <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/crasx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matthew Ramir drupal.org\">Matthew Ramir</a> of <a href=\"https://www.bounteous.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bounteous homepage\">Bounteous</a> showing how to use Composer to update to Drupal 10 and beyond. He starts off with an explanation of how Composer tracks and manages dependencies, followed by a section about checking for upgrade compatibility with the Upgrade Status module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second half of the article covers using Composer to update PHP versions before a step-by-step breakdown of how to upgrade Drupal core, including how to handle potential conflicts when upgrading; some of these can be easily resolved (e.g. requiring the latest version of a module), while some may require custom solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2023/02/22/upgrading-drupal-10-and-beyond-composer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bounteous: Upgrading to Drupal 10 (And Beyond) With Composer\"><strong>Read more about updating Drupal with Composer</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Drupal Is the Smart Choice for Higher Education</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we have an article by <a href=\"https://www.acquia.com\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Acquia homepage\">Acquia</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/about-us/team/sylvie-tse\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sylvie Tse Acquia\">Sylvie Tse</a> about why Drupal is the content management system of choice for a number of renowned higher education institutions, such as Stanford and Princeton.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most essential tenets of education is that it should be accessible to everyone, and so a large section of Sylvie’s article is dedicated to accessibility tips and tricks for content managers, designers and developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article also showcases a few of the most compelling features of Drupal and Acquia for higher education – namely, the power of personalization through a case study for the University of Dundee, and the streamlined multisite management which has helped institutions such as Rice University.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/blog/why-drupal-smart-choice-higher-education\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Acquia: Why Drupal Is the Smart Choice for Higher Education\"><strong>Read more about Drupal for higher education</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hands-On With Drupal 10: Crafting Content With CKEditor 5</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue with an article by <a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web homepage\">Evolving Web</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katarinabundy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kate Bundy Twitter\">Kate Bundy</a> about the improvements of the Drupal 10 content editing experience thanks to the latest CKEditor 5. She starts off with an overview of the new features available in Drupal core: an improved user interface; balloon panels; easier management of tables; updated style dropdown; and streamlined creation of complex lists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to this, CKEditor 5 also has a premium version which comes with additional features such as tracking changes, revision history, real-time collaboration, exporting to Word or PDF, and more. Some upcoming features include autoformatting and support for TypeScript plugins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com/blog/hands-drupal-10-crafting-content-ckeditor-5\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web: Hands-On With Drupal 10: Crafting Content With CKEditor 5\"><strong>Read more about CKEditor 5 in Drupal 10</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal 10 is here – Are You Ready for It?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have an article on <a href=\"https://www.perficient.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Perficient homepage\">Perficient</a>’s blog giving a short overview of the new features in Drupal 10 and the main reasons why site owners should upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible. As the article’s author <a href=\"https://blogs.perficient.com/author/rramdoss/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Raghuraman Ramdoss Perficient\">Raghuraman Ramdoss</a> points out, the main reason for upgrading is the looming end-of-life date of Drupal 9 and its dependencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, the newer versions of these outdated dependencies make the Drupal platform even more powerful.

          "processed": "<p>Like every month, we’re bringing you a selection of our team’s favorite Drupal articles from the past month. Check out what we read in February.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>The Rise of OpenAI and ChatGPT</h3>\n\n<p>We’re kicking off this month’s list with an article that’s not exclusively focused on Drupal, but nevertheless covers a topic so important that it definitely deserved a spot: the rise of generative artificial intelligence, namely, OpenAI and ChatGPT.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.velir.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Velir homepage\">Velir</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kevinquillen\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kevin Quillen Twitter\">Kevin Quillen</a>, author of the article, first tells the reader more about OpenAI and what kind of projects their AI powers before diving into the specifics of integrating OpenAI with Drupal via its API.</p>\n\n<p>Kevin breaks down 5 features of using OpenAI in Drupal: prompt/text generation explorer; content generation; integration with the CKEditor; log analysis; and text embedding. He also lists some features that are currently still in development and are likely to be available in the future.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.velir.com/ideas/2023/02/16/the-rise-of-openai-and-chatgpt\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Velir: The Rise of OpenAI and ChatGPT\"><strong>Read more about using OpenAI in Drupal</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Artificial Intelligence, the future of Content Management and the Web</h3>\n\n<p>Let’s continue in the same context, with an article by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Dries\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries Buytaert Twitter\">Dries</a> about AI and its impact on content management and the web as a whole, which also references the above article by Kevin by showcasing some example features of his OpenAI-Drupal integration.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most notable impacts of artificial intelligence which Dries highlights is its disintermediation of traditional search engines, an important step in what he calls the “Big Reverse of the Web”.</p>\n\n<p>Besides the impact and use in content management, the article also talks about the current and future usage of AI in software development, before finishing with some challenges and concerns of generative AI such as legal/copyright issues.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dri.es/artificial-intelligence-the-future-of-content-management-and-the-web\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries: Artificial Intelligence, the future of Content Management and the Web\"><strong>Read Dries’s thoughts on AI and its impact on the web</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Upgrading to Drupal 10 (And Beyond) With Composer</h3>\n\n<p>Now, for the first Drupal-specific article in this month’s selection, we have <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/crasx\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matthew Ramir drupal.org\">Matthew Ramir</a> of <a href=\"https://www.bounteous.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bounteous homepage\">Bounteous</a> showing how to use Composer to update to Drupal 10 and beyond. He starts off with an explanation of how Composer tracks and manages dependencies, followed by a section about checking for upgrade compatibility with the Upgrade Status module.</p>\n\n<p>The second half of the article covers using Composer to update PHP versions before a step-by-step breakdown of how to upgrade Drupal core, including how to handle potential conflicts when upgrading; some of these can be easily resolved (e.g. requiring the latest version of a module), while some may require custom solutions.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bounteous.com/insights/2023/02/22/upgrading-drupal-10-and-beyond-composer\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bounteous: Upgrading to Drupal 10 (And Beyond) With Composer\"><strong>Read more about updating Drupal with Composer</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Why Drupal Is the Smart Choice for Higher Education</h3>\n\n<p>Next up, we have an article by <a href=\"https://www.acquia.com\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Acquia homepage\">Acquia</a>’s <a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/about-us/team/sylvie-tse\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sylvie Tse Acquia\">Sylvie Tse</a> about why Drupal is the content management system of choice for a number of renowned higher education institutions, such as Stanford and Princeton.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most essential tenets of education is that it should be accessible to everyone, and so a large section of Sylvie’s article is dedicated to accessibility tips and tricks for content managers, designers and developers.</p>\n\n<p>The article also showcases a few of the most compelling features of Drupal and Acquia for higher education – namely, the power of personalization through a case study for the University of Dundee, and the streamlined multisite management which has helped institutions such as Rice University.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/blog/why-drupal-smart-choice-higher-education\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Acquia: Why Drupal Is the Smart Choice for Higher Education\"><strong>Read more about Drupal for higher education</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Hands-On With Drupal 10: Crafting Content With CKEditor 5</h3>\n\n<p>We continue with an article by <a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web homepage\">Evolving Web</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/katarinabundy\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Kate Bundy Twitter\">Kate Bundy</a> about the improvements of the Drupal 10 content editing experience thanks to the latest CKEditor 5. She starts off with an overview of the new features available in Drupal core: an improved user interface; balloon panels; easier management of tables; updated style dropdown; and streamlined creation of complex lists.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to this, CKEditor 5 also has a premium version which comes with additional features such as tracking changes, revision history, real-time collaboration, exporting to Word or PDF, and more. Some upcoming features include autoformatting and support for TypeScript plugins.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com/blog/hands-drupal-10-crafting-content-ckeditor-5\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web: Hands-On With Drupal 10: Crafting Content With CKEditor 5\"><strong>Read more about CKEditor 5 in Drupal 10</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Drupal 10 is here – Are You Ready for It?</h3>\n\n<p>Moving on, we have an article on <a href=\"https://www.perficient.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Perficient homepage\">Perficient</a>’s blog giving a short overview of the new features in Drupal 10 and the main reasons why site owners should upgrade to the latest version as soon as possible. As the article’s author <a href=\"https://blogs.perficient.com/author/rramdoss/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Raghuraman Ramdoss Perficient\">Raghuraman Ramdoss</a> points out, the main reason for upgrading is the looming end-of-life date of Drupal 9 and its dependencies.</p>\n\n<p>However, the newer versions of these outdated dependencies make the Drupal platform even more powerful. Drupal 10 runs on the latest versions of PHP and Symfony, streamlines content management with the new CKEditor 5, and facilitates all admin work through the new core theme Claro.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blogs.perficient.com/2023/02/20/drupal-10-is-here-are-you-ready-for-it/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Perficient: Drupal 10 is here – Are You Ready for It?\"><strong>Read more about Drupal 10</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>How “Laziness” Improves Performance: Exploring the Image Lazy-loading Technique in Drupal</h3>\n\n<p>Another great article from last month comes from the <a href=\"https://imagexmedia.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ImageX homepage\">ImageX</a> team and shows how to use lazy loading to optimize the images and thus the performance of your Drupal website.

In the first section, Jordan shows how to install Cypress in your Drupal project and configure it for end-to-end (E2E) testing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, he shows how to write and run basic tests with Cypress, before concluding with a section on customizing it for Drupal. Here you’re able to write custom commands, giving you neat user experience benefits such as logging users in based on their uid and thus not having to store or read passwords during testing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://atendesigngroup.com/articles/how-use-cypress-testing-drupal\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Aten Design Group: How to Use Cypress for Testing Drupal\"><strong>Read more about using Cypress in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Get Involved: Ways to Contribute to Drupal, No Experience Required</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we have a great article from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gregory_boggs\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Greg Boggs Twitter\">Greg Boggs</a> intended primarily for people who are hesitant to contribute to Drupal or another open-source project because they lack development expertise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He breaks down a list of ways to get involved, many of which consist of very much needed non-developer contributions, e.g. writing/improving documentation, helping with translations, design and user experience, promoting and marketing, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to these, Greg also includes a list of resources where new contributors can get additional help and/or places where they can start easily contributing to Drupal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gregboggs.com/get-started-contributing-to-drupal/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Greg Boggs: Get Involved: Ways to Contribute to Drupal, No Experience Required\"><strong>Read more about getting involved with Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hot New Feature in Drupal 10: Views Responsive Grids!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next article from January, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Nadine_Alladine\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nadine Nykolaichuk Twitter\">Nadine Nykolaichuk</a> of <a href=\"https://imagexmedia.com\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ImageX homepage\">ImageX</a> presents an important new feature in Drupal 10, Views Responsive Grids. It is an enhancement of the new front-end theme Olivero developed by Olivero lead <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeherchel\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mike Herchel Twitter\">Mike Herchel</a>, who also announced it in an article and presented it during DrupalCon Prague last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As its name suggests, the feature enables users to easily create responsive grids using Drupal’s Views UI. This is achieved using modern CSS features which are now possible thanks to the inclusion of Olivero in Drupal Core and the end of support for Internet Explorer 11.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://imagexmedia.com/blog/Views-responsive-grids-drupal-10-core\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ImageX: Hot New Feature in Drupal 10: Views Responsive Grids!\"><strong>Read more about Views Responsive Grids</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Microsites in Drupal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue with an article from <a href=\"https://www.lullabot.com\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lullabot homepage\">Lullabot</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jazzdrive3\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matt Robison Twitter\">Matt Robison</a> about implementing microsites in Drupal. He starts off by defining the concept of microsite and giving a few examples where microsites might be used, e.g. for specific departments of higher education / government institutions, or for the top shows of a television network.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next section shows how to change the look and feel of a website section in Drupal, a key feature for microsites. Another thing to consider is how content is treated under microsites, and Matt also shows everything in practice with an example of a product company developing separate microsites for each individual product.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lullabot.com/articles/microsites-drupal\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lullabot: Microsites in Drupal\"><strong>Read more about microsites in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>To Drupal, or Not to Drupal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next on our list is not a single blog post but a series of five posts written by <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/jumpsuitgreen\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"David Kirkwood drupal.org\">David Kirkwood</a> of <a href=\"https://www.electriccitizen.com\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Electric Citizen homepage\">Electric Citizen</a> about migrating off Drupal 7, and what options and considerations to keep top of mind here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key point in the series is that migrating from Drupal 7 will be difficult no matter what platform you decide on, and so ease of upgrade should not be among your main criteria.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, you should consider things such as recent developments and updates in Drupal, as well as how much you need to outsource and how you’re going to handle knowledge attrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.electriccitizen.com/citizen-blog/drupal-or-not-drupal-part-1\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Electric Citizen: To Drupal, or Not to Drupal: Part 1\"><strong>Read To Drupal, or Not to Drupal part 1</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal 10: Using Context Definitions To Create Context Aware Plugins</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, this article by <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/philipnorton42\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Philip Norton drupal.org\">Philip Norton</a> on his blog <a href=\"https://www.hashbangcode.com\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#!

What I love most about conferences was very much present here as well: an open, welcoming community, with lots of mingling and networking. It was a great privilege to get to meet community members that I previously only followed on Twitter and elsewhere on the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All of the people I met at the conference were very interesting to talk to. I think I had the most interesting conversation with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PovilasKorop\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Povilas Korop Twitter\">Povilas</a> from <a href=\"https://laraveldaily.com/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Laravel Daily homepage\">Laravel Daily</a> who creates content for Laravel developers, teaching them best practices and standards and how to do certain things with Laravel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is highly aligned with one of Agiledrop’s biggest goals for 2023 (<a href=\"/blog/2022-review\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 2022 in review\">which I wrote about recently here</a>), namely, creating a high-level onboarding/training program for Laravel developers. So, whenever we hire a new PHP developer, whether they know Laravel or not, we can still have them go through this program and get familiar with all of the best practices and standards used in the Laravel community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are definitely going to be using his content as well because he really generates a lot of great content there, and I feel that this is going to be a great addition to our company's portfolio of learning resources. Hopefully, at one point, we can collaborate on something with him that can benefit the entire community.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"bbacb6ad-8788-4ab3-b794-c3cc673dd9ad\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>Since I spent so much time in the common area, either working or networking, I didn’t manage to catch that many sessions, but the ones I did catch were excellent. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taylorotwell\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Taylor Otwell Twitter\">Taylor Otwell</a>’s keynote about Laravel 10 was definitely at the top. His way of presenting was very exciting and made the whole keynote feel like an event from Apple when they release a new iPhone, with the whole audience cheering and clapping. It was just the perfect way to get people even more enthusiastic and excited about the new release as well as boost the whole event up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If I remember correctly, Taylor even mentioned in the Q&amp;A session that he likes to keep certain features secret and then reveal them at conferences. So, he’s definitely doing it consciously, and I think it’s a great strategy which gives a ton of energy to the events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In general, a lot of the sessions were heavily technical, with a lot of live coding/demoing; but there was a nice mix of non-technical sessions as well, with topics such as mental health and productivity, which I believe were also very valuable for the almost exclusively developer crowd there as well as for the community at large.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of my favorite sessions was delivered by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/aarondfrancis\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Aaron Francis Twitter\">Aaron Francis</a> who talked about how to do things that increase your surface area for luck.

It was just a fantastic story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another very interesting element of the Laracon experience for me was how it compared with another open-source community that I’ve been involved with for a long time – Drupal (I’m pretty sure I annoyed at least a few people at the Laracon with these comparisons and explanations of how the Drupal community does things differently).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Drupal and Laravel are very open and welcoming to newcomers. I feel like the Laravel community is more technical, since I didn’t notice any of the business-oriented sessions which are a mainstay at DrupalCons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consequently, a lot of attendees of Drupal events are non-developer clients, e.g. marketing or business development people from certain companies who want to get to know the platform which they might use in the future. I don’t think this happens that often in Laravel due to the format and the technology itself.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably the biggest difference between Laravel and Drupal is in how they’re led. Drupal is very much run on the level of local communities, and just by the community as a whole. There are a lot more community members involved in contributing to the core platform and to event organization; whereas with Laravel, everything seems to be much more centralized, although both of them are on a very high level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One potential downside of being very centralized and not having that much community involvement is the lack of connections between the local communities.

Now we’d like to provide a sort of follow-up post which takes a look at specific considerations for a website upgrade or redesign, as an add-on to more big-picture website strategy considerations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll be breaking down three crucial areas that deserve your attention when planning an upgrade/redesign, where you’ll likely also be making relatively significant changes to the look and certain functionality of your website. This breakdown will include both elaborating on points from the original article as well as introducing some additional ones which are of particular concern here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Content</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Content is one of the most important areas to check when performing a redesign, not least because of how design changes affect the presentation of the content (especially if it’s shipped on many different channels/platforms), as well as your SEO efforts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of the boxes to tick off to ensure your content stays aligned with your newly designed website:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Recheck your copy</strong> – especially your <a href=\"/blog/microcopy-what-it-and-why-it-important\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Microcopy: What is it and why is it important\"><strong>microcopy</strong></a>, i.e. your headlines, calls to action, etc. as well as your privacy policy and terms of service to ensure they’re up to date with both your brand as well as regulations such as GDPR.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Check for and refresh outdated content</strong>, as well as any critical pieces of content that need to be kept as up to date as possible. This includes fixing broken/outdated links (don’t forget to recheck the links afterwards for the pieces of content you end up updating).</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Check for redundant content</strong>, including both content types which are no longer in use as well as 404/unpublished pages and pages left over from certain promotional campaigns. Such spring cleaning will both improve your website’s performance by reducing its overall weight as well as streamline the content management experience.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>User experience</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As we pointed out in the original article, a good user experience is vital to your content’s and thus your website’s effectiveness. In this section, we’ll expand on the main points we highlighted there.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Check and optimize images and other media</strong>. Check for broken images, images that load slowly or incorrectly due to potential platform changes, consider adding features such as lazy loading if you’re not using them yet, and/or consider whether or not a novel web image format such as WebP would make sense for your website.\r\n\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>In addition, check that your images have <strong>appropriate alternative tex</strong>t to ensure website visitors using assistive technologies such as screen readers and/or users with a poor internet connection can still get value out of them – which leads us to the next point:</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Make sure you’re maintaining accessibility.</strong> If you’re planning a more complete brand redesign, keep accessibility top of mind for your new brand’s <strong>design system / style guide</strong>; i.e. recheck colors and contrast, fonts and font sizes, as well as front-end elements such as modals and forms which are more likely to be affected by certain software changes.\r\n\t<ul>\r\n\t\t<li>Another important thing to check is <strong>how your interactive elements function</strong>, e.g. if video/audio gets played automatically (which can translate into an inaccessible experience for some), if you have landing page elements/content that jumps around (also very important for <strong>Core Web Vitals</strong>, namely <strong>Cumulative Layout Shift</strong>), etc.</li>\r\n\t</ul>\r\n\t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Out-of-date software</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of issues with user experience and content presentation are caused by <strong>out-of-date software</strong>. When performing an upgrade or redesign, you’ll typically want to have your website run on the latest version of whichever platform you’re using – in fact, it’s often the reason <em>why</em> you’ve decided on an upgrade in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, check if there is a new (minor or major) platform update you can make, as well as any out-of-date software and its dependencies that may cause issues with security and/or user experience, and as such also need updating or removing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As we stated earlier, it’s also important to check for potential changes to the front-end and back-end experiences after performing these updates to ensure things still function as intended.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since a platform update often includes new features, you should also check for <strong>potential conflict and/or redundancy with your website’s existing functionality</strong>, especially if you’ve been using custom features which are now handled by the core platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A redesign is also a great opportunity to review your company’s overall <strong>technical debt</strong> and whether you need to do anything about it at this time. If you’re performing a larger platform update alongside a redesign, this might be the perfect time to square up your technical debt now and ensure smoother website upgrades in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope this article will help you get the most out of your next website upgrade/redesign.

On top of that, we got great ratings on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/agile-digital-transformation/id1532372413?uo=4\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Apple Podcasts: Agile Digital Transformation\">Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href=\"https://blog.feedspot.com/digital_transformation_podcasts/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"FeedSpot: 35 Best Digital Transformation Podcasts\">got featured</a> in several lists of <a href=\"https://whatfix.com/blog/digital-transformation-podcasts/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Whatfix: 25 Best Digital Transformation Podcasts in 2023\">top digital transformation podcasts</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our client services team was keeping the entire team busy, onboarding satisfied clients in addition to procuring extensions and new engagements with our existing clients. We also successfully expanded into more JavaScript and Laravel specific projects in addition to Drupal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best things about 2022 for our marketing and sales was the heavily anticipated return of in-person conferences. We sponsored three – <a href=\"/blog/drupal-devdays-2022-revisiting-my-first-person-drupal-event\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Drupal DevDays 2022 – Revisiting my first in-person Drupal event\">Drupal DevDays</a>, <a href=\"/blog/drupalcon-2022-ghent-portland-two-weeks\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: DrupalCon 2022: From Ghent to Portland in two weeks\">DrupalCon US</a> and <a href=\"/blog/drupalcon-prague-2022-first-person-european-drupalcon-after-3-years\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: DrupalCon Prague 2022 – the first in-person European DrupalCon after 3 years\">DrupalCon EU</a> – and attended many more, e.g. Acquia Engage in Miami and the Smart Country Convention in Berlin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I really need to thank everyone who contributed to these wins: Tim for advancing our already streamlined marketing strategy; Aleš for leading the sales team and ensuring the top-notch quality of our client services; Jure for his contributions to our 2022 sales successes; and the two newest client advisors Andreja and Vuk for getting immediately involved in our sale processes and setting themselves up for success in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Finances &amp; operations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the economic uncertainties, our financial results were quite impressive, with a 14% growth in revenue compared to 2021. We remain profitable and stable, with a diversified income that doesn’t depend on a single client, market or technology, and several long-term and multi-year contracts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We greatly streamlined our approach to internally managed projects, and we have plans for this to become a more prominent work model this year. We became even better at catching issues early on and thus managing incidents and risks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the HR department, we also fully implemented the hybrid work model which is now even better supported by new features of our internal Dashboard app, such as electronic signatures and anonymous feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here I’d like to thank Domen, Ivana, Maja and Nana, who have all gone above and beyond in their work; all of them have been essential to our processes running like clockwork and to the constant improvements to our company’s efficiency and reliability, both to our clients and our employees.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>People &amp; activities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Although last year saw a lot of upheaval in the job market, we managed to grow our team to 81 full-time employees, and we even designed and moved to a brand new office for our Maribor team in March.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We introduced quite a few novelties to our internal activities, i.e. a new type of office event, AgileOff, which can be any kind of team activity – a theatre show, a boat trip, or anything in between (we did both of these and many more in 2022), and an office budget for each individual office whose members get to decide how to best spend it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, we organized 15 internal events, ranging from Drupal courses to AgileOff events, as well as the annual family picnic and Christmas dinner – after a long time without any Covid restrictions! Each of our offices got into a foosball frenzy table last year, and so foosball tournaments have become a regular feature of pretty much every team get-together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, we sponsored 2 local community events, a tech JobFair and the Dragonhack hackathon where our development director Bostjan also gave a talk about open-source software. Last but not least, we sponsored and hosted a <a href=\"/blog/drupal-10-release-party-recap\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Drupal 10 release party recap\">Drupal meetup to celebrate the release of Drupal 10</a> in December.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A huge thanks to Lena, our event organizer and PR specialist, who not only made sure all of these events were running smoothly, but also kept improving the quality and frequency of all these events and ensuring everyone on the team had the opportunity to connect and engage with other team members.

Due to all the other activities, we only had one AgileTalk and no internal workshops – but we already have plans to revive and streamline these in 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I mentioned in the part about sales success, we increased the scope of JavaScript work (for example, we did an AngularJS to React migration) as well as improved our Laravel offering – we’ve noticed that it’s a very desired technology among developers, and so we’ll be preparing a proper onboarding in order to build a dedicated Laravel team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another big change for developers was the introduction of more frequent performance reviews – twice a year instead of annually – which I already wrote about as one of our major plans in <a href=\"/blog/2021-review\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 2021 in review\">last year’s review</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lifting of Covid restrictions was very welcome for our developers as well, with quite a few of them making in-person visits to the clients they work with, as well as our clients visiting the Agiledrop offices in Ljubljana and Maribor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every developer on our team deserves high praise for their commitment and reliability which are vital to the great relationships we have with our clients – thank you all! A special thanks also goes to Janez, Benjamin, Nate and Tjasa for their dedication as development mentors, and of course to Bostjan for setting the example for the entire development department.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Plans and goals for 2023</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Considering the current economic and social situation, our 2023 goals are more grounded rather than very lofty. The number one goal is thus making sure we remain in stable financial condition. Besides that, we have a number of small but key optimizations planned for our internal activities and processes, which include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>More strongly aligning our sales and marketing to further develop and optimize our brand strategy,</li>\r\n\t<li>Attending and organizing more events, both courses and AgileOff-style events as well as technology conferences (e.g. Laracon),</li>\r\n\t<li>Developing an internal tool to facilitate event organization,</li>\r\n\t<li>Streamline onboarding and learning opportunities for Laravel development.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>But the main reason why 2023 will be a big year for Agiledrop is that we’ll be celebrating our company’s 10th birthday in September. We don’t know yet exactly how we’ll mark the occasion, but it’ll have to be something big!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>I hope 2023 turns out to be a great year for all of you reading right now as well. All of us at Agiledrop wish you a healthy and successful year filled with the most memorable experiences!</strong></em><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n",

Besides that, we have a number of small but key optimizations planned for our internal activities and processes, which include:</p>\n\n<ul><li>More strongly aligning our sales and marketing to further develop and optimize our brand strategy,</li>\n\t<li>Attending and organizing more events, both courses and AgileOff-style events as well as technology conferences (e.g. Laracon),</li>\n\t<li>Developing an internal tool to facilitate event organization,</li>\n\t<li>Streamline onboarding and learning opportunities for Laravel development.</li>\n</ul><p>But the main reason why 2023 will be a big year for Agiledrop is that we’ll be celebrating our company’s 10th birthday in September. We don’t know yet exactly how we’ll mark the occasion, but it’ll have to be something big!</p>\n\n<p><em><strong>I hope 2023 turns out to be a great year for all of you reading right now as well. All of us at Agiledrop wish you a healthy and successful year filled with the most memorable experiences!</strong></em><br />\n </p>\n",

          "value": "<p>Have you heard of ORM in digital marketing? Well, if you are a programmer, you may be familiar with ORM as <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-orm-the-meaning-of-object-relational-mapping-database-tools/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"FreeCodeCamp: What is an ORM – The Meaning of Object Relational Mapping Database Tools\">object relational mapping</a>, but in online marketing, it refers to online reputation management.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You may not have given ORM too much thought in your day-to-day operations. Yet, there is one fact about being a business owner that you cannot ignore, and that is, no matter how good your products or services are, you will get some type of feedback.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the best-case scenario, you always wish for positive feedback. But, sometimes, there can be negative comments. Feedback that could sound the death knell for your brand. Now, here is where it gets tricky. Sometimes, you may not even know that you are damaging your reputation inadvertently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Online Reputation Management (ORM) is the process of actively tracking, managing, and influencing your organization's reputation in the digital landscape. It involves monitoring mentions of your brand or any negative comments or feedback, identifying the source, and responding to those comments strategically, in order to protect and promote your brand.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It also involves building relationships, engaging with customers, reviewing opportunities for improvement, identifying negative press and comments about your products or services, and developing a plan for improving your online presence. ORM helps organizations control the conversation by taking proactive steps to manage their presence and influence their brand’s conversations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let's take the example of organic link building. The idea is to get hyperlinks to your website from other sites. But, you don't take the time to research the linking site. Neither do you get the help of a link building agency to help with organic or quality link building.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It later emerges that the website has low authority and a bad reputation due to its content. And just like that, the audiences link your brand to less-than-savory characters. Unflattering comments start to appear about your brand. At this point, an ORM strategy would come to your rescue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This article explores ORM in digital marketing and shows how it can help build better relationships with customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Understanding Online Reputation Management (ORM)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Online reputation management (ORM) is a broad term that incorporates many things. These include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Active monitoring of brand mentions for any negative or false commentary</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Any steps you take to guard the brand reputation in the digital space</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Managing</strong>: Reactive actions to manage any negative or inaccurate reports.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>A solid ORM strategy aims to improve how your brand looks online. So let's go back to the example of organic link building we mentioned above. You can mitigate negative associations by investing in <a href=\"https://linkdoctor.io\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkDoctor homepage\">SEO link building services</a>. In this case, the <strong>link building agency</strong> would have researched the linking websites. They will use the necessary tools to check domain authority and reputation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The link building services providers will also keep a close watch for brand mentions. That way, they get to know what people are saying about your company across the digital and offline space. In managing negative comments, the link building agency can engage the site owners. They can ask them to remove your link.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But what does ORM have to do with digital marketing and building better customer relationships?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ORM in Digital Marketing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The internet opened the digital space in a way many would not have imagined. There are many business opportunities, brand-building initiatives and information. There is access to a broad audience base and 24/7 access to customers.<br />\r\nBut with the good come some significant negatives. You see, news on the internet spreads faster than the wildest bushfire. One poor review from a disgruntled customer can reach millions in seconds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do you know that <a href=\"https://trustmary.com/reviews/online-reviews-statistics-that-will-blow-your-mind/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"TrustMary: Online Reviews: Statistics That Will Blow Your Mind [2022]\">94% of customers</a> would rather not engage with a company with negative reviews? If you have one or two-star ratings, only 9% of customers will be willing to transact with you. 53% expect the brand to respond to negative reviews within a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how can you expect to respond if you don't have a link building agency monitoring your brand mentions? Further, how can you react if you do not have an ORM strategy? Indeed, a solid digital strategy must dedicate a whole section to ORM.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>ORM and Better Customer Relations</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Online reputation management is key to developing and fostering positive customer connections. Utilizing this savvy strategy can help build relationships that last, enhancing the quality of communication and collaboration for everyone involved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By investing in reputation management solutions, businesses can gain an edge in strengthening their customer relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Increased Customer Confidence in Your Brand</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the essential areas in digital marketing is brand building. And a primary concern for digital marketers is maintaining a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/06/why-maintaining-your-business-reputation-is-essential-during-tough-economic-periods/?sh=5d72dfa2a53d\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Forbes: Why Maintaining Your Business Reputation Is Essential During Tough Economic Periods\">positive brand reputation</a>. We already shared some statistics above on why this is critical to the brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let's continue to use the example of organic link building. High-quality links to high-domain sites are excellent ways to showcase industry authority. It is also an endorsement by the linking site that you are credible and trustworthy. That is why you should consider getting whitehat link building services. The more you build a reputation of trustworthiness, the more confidence people have in your brand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, as we stated, sometimes quality link building can go wrong if you don't know how to do it. A mistake on your part can lead to negative feedback from online audiences. Remember we talked about ORM including monitoring online brand mentions? Catching feedback early can allow for proactive action to get rid of such negative feedback.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Better Trust amongst Customers with ORM</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes some brands make is to ignore customer feedback or reviews. Yet, therein lies a powerful tool to foster closer relationships with customers. Place yourself in the customers' shoes for a minute. You give a review or commentary, and the brand does not react in any way. For many, it is an unforgivable slight that will have them running to the competitors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having an excellent ORM system can help organizations address negative feedback and reviews gracefully. Moreover, it will foster trust between them and their customers by showcasing their commitment to transparency.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People appreciate companies that are willing to admit errors and accept responsibility for making improvements. On the contrary, those who choose to sweep customer complaints under the rug risk losing credibility. By taking a proactive stance, businesses can boost their reputations and demonstrate respect for their customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Greater Brand Visibility, Thus Better Customer Relationships</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Creating greater visibility for a brand is key to building customer relationships. By increasing visibility of the brand, customers can learn more about it, be exposed to its products and services, and grow a connection to the company.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Utilizing various marketing strategies and channels such as social media, advertising, search engine optimization, and influencer marketing, companies can reach larger audiences and leverage relationships with their target customers. With effective communication and engaging content, a brand can create an emotional connection with its customers, build brand loyalty, and strengthen its relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That said, let us start by drawing a critical distinction between SEO and ORM. SEO (search engine optimization) is about improving rankings on search engines. It incorporates techniques like content generation, organic link building, and fixing broken links.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ORM is about maintaining the brand reputation by managing or fixing bad reviews. You can showcase the positive aspects of your business. The same applies to capitalizing on positive customer reviews. Indeed, even keeping up with responding to negative reviews can boost brand visibility. You can push negative reviews to lower positions in search results. All you need are the right tactics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does brand visibility have to do with better customer relationships? Well, always have the following at the back of your mind:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Customers will research a brand or product online before buying. Appearing in top search results increases the chances of getting organic leads. It can also lead to more conversions.</li>\r\n\t<li>Appearing in the top search results signifies a trustworthy and credible company.</li>\r\n\t<li>Positive brand mentions are great for building trust. The chances of conversions and referrals from happy customers increase.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Better Customer Management with ORM</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>ORM has more to offer the brand beyond mere reputation management. Indeed, you can better manage customers with a solid ORM strategy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Prompt responses</strong> to customer concerns will always win you brownie points. Let's say a customer complains about something via your inbox or chat line. At this point, you have enough time to take proactive measures to avoid an escalation.&nbsp;Remember, you can turn a dissatisfied customer into a disgruntled, fire-breathing keyboard warrior. How? By ignoring them. In no time, negative reviews will be flying all over. Before you know it, the 'fires' are spreading all over the internet, especially social media.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Show <a href=\"/podcast/ivan-stegic-leading-empathy\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Ivan Stegic - Leading with empathy\">empathy</a> and care</strong> with how you handle negative reviews or comments. Every customer has some fundamental needs. And one of them is for companies they interact with to treat them well.&nbsp;Showing empathy removes the transactional feel from the engagement. It solidifies the fact it is not only about making money, but rather the chance to build fruitful relationships.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Address customer dissatisfaction</strong> that can result in poor press for the brand. A business fact is that you may not be able to avoid negativity in its entirety. What matters is how you respond.&nbsp;By now, it should be clear that ignoring unhappy customers is something you should never do. Let the customers know you hear them, and will work to resolve their issues as soon as possible. That simple act builds trust in your brand and what you have to say.</li>\r\n\t<li>ORM provides a chance to <strong>own up to and rectify your mistakes</strong>. It would be easy to think that customers demand perfection from brands. But that may not be the case for all customers. For sure, they want the best you can offer.

          "processed": "<p>Have you heard of ORM in digital marketing? Well, if you are a programmer, you may be familiar with ORM as <a href=\"https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-an-orm-the-meaning-of-object-relational-mapping-database-tools/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"FreeCodeCamp: What is an ORM – The Meaning of Object Relational Mapping Database Tools\">object relational mapping</a>, but in online marketing, it refers to online reputation management. </p>\n\n<p>You may not have given ORM too much thought in your day-to-day operations. Yet, there is one fact about being a business owner that you cannot ignore, and that is, no matter how good your products or services are, you will get some type of feedback. </p>\n\n<p>In the best-case scenario, you always wish for positive feedback. But, sometimes, there can be negative comments. Feedback that could sound the death knell for your brand. Now, here is where it gets tricky. Sometimes, you may not even know that you are damaging your reputation inadvertently.</p>\n\n<p>Online Reputation Management (ORM) is the process of actively tracking, managing, and influencing your organization's reputation in the digital landscape. It involves monitoring mentions of your brand or any negative comments or feedback, identifying the source, and responding to those comments strategically, in order to protect and promote your brand. </p>\n\n<p>It also involves building relationships, engaging with customers, reviewing opportunities for improvement, identifying negative press and comments about your products or services, and developing a plan for improving your online presence. ORM helps organizations control the conversation by taking proactive steps to manage their presence and influence their brand’s conversations.</p>\n\n<p>Let's take the example of organic link building. The idea is to get hyperlinks to your website from other sites. But, you don't take the time to research the linking site. Neither do you get the help of a link building agency to help with organic or quality link building.</p>\n\n<p>It later emerges that the website has low authority and a bad reputation due to its content. And just like that, the audiences link your brand to less-than-savory characters. Unflattering comments start to appear about your brand. At this point, an ORM strategy would come to your rescue.</p>\n\n<p>This article explores ORM in digital marketing and shows how it can help build better relationships with customers.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Understanding Online Reputation Management (ORM)</h2>\n\n<p>Online reputation management (ORM) is a broad term that incorporates many things. These include:</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: Active monitoring of brand mentions for any negative or false commentary</li>\n\t<li><strong>Mitigation</strong>: Any steps you take to guard the brand reputation in the digital space</li>\n\t<li><strong>Managing</strong>: Reactive actions to manage any negative or inaccurate reports.</li>\n</ul><p>A solid ORM strategy aims to improve how your brand looks online. So let's go back to the example of organic link building we mentioned above. You can mitigate negative associations by investing in <a href=\"https://linkdoctor.io\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"LinkDoctor homepage\">SEO link building services</a>. In this case, the <strong>link building agency</strong> would have researched the linking websites. They will use the necessary tools to check domain authority and reputation.</p>\n\n<p>The link building services providers will also keep a close watch for brand mentions. That way, they get to know what people are saying about your company across the digital and offline space. In managing negative comments, the link building agency can engage the site owners. They can ask them to remove your link.</p>\n\n<p>But what does ORM have to do with digital marketing and building better customer relationships?</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>ORM in Digital Marketing</h2>\n\n<p>The internet opened the digital space in a way many would not have imagined. There are many business opportunities, brand-building initiatives and information. There is access to a broad audience base and 24/7 access to customers.<br />\nBut with the good come some significant negatives. You see, news on the internet spreads faster than the wildest bushfire. One poor review from a disgruntled customer can reach millions in seconds.</p>\n\n<p>Do you know that <a href=\"https://trustmary.com/reviews/online-reviews-statistics-that-will-blow-your-mind/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"TrustMary: Online Reviews: Statistics That Will Blow Your Mind [2022]\">94% of customers</a> would rather not engage with a company with negative reviews? If you have one or two-star ratings, only 9% of customers will be willing to transact with you. 53% expect the brand to respond to negative reviews within a week.</p>\n\n<p>So, how can you expect to respond if you don't have a link building agency monitoring your brand mentions? Further, how can you react if you do not have an ORM strategy? Indeed, a solid digital strategy must dedicate a whole section to ORM.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>ORM and Better Customer Relations</h2>\n\n<p>Online reputation management is key to developing and fostering positive customer connections. Utilizing this savvy strategy can help build relationships that last, enhancing the quality of communication and collaboration for everyone involved. </p>\n\n<p>By investing in reputation management solutions, businesses can gain an edge in strengthening their customer relationships.</p>\n\n<h3>Increased Customer Confidence in Your Brand</h3>\n\n<p>One of the essential areas in digital marketing is brand building. And a primary concern for digital marketers is maintaining a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/06/06/why-maintaining-your-business-reputation-is-essential-during-tough-economic-periods/?sh=5d72dfa2a53d\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Forbes: Why Maintaining Your Business Reputation Is Essential During Tough Economic Periods\">positive brand reputation</a>. We already shared some statistics above on why this is critical to the brand.</p>\n\n<p>Let's continue to use the example of organic link building. High-quality links to high-domain sites are excellent ways to showcase industry authority. It is also an endorsement by the linking site that you are credible and trustworthy. That is why you should consider getting whitehat link building services. The more you build a reputation of trustworthiness, the more confidence people have in your brand.</p>\n\n<p>But, as we stated, sometimes quality link building can go wrong if you don't know how to do it. A mistake on your part can lead to negative feedback from online audiences. Remember we talked about ORM including monitoring online brand mentions? Catching feedback early can allow for proactive action to get rid of such negative feedback.</p>\n\n<h3>Better Trust amongst Customers with ORM</h3>\n\n<p>One of the biggest mistakes some brands make is to ignore customer feedback or reviews. Yet, therein lies a powerful tool to foster closer relationships with customers. Place yourself in the customers' shoes for a minute. You give a review or commentary, and the brand does not react in any way. For many, it is an unforgivable slight that will have them running to the competitors.</p>\n\n<p>Having an excellent ORM system can help organizations address negative feedback and reviews gracefully. Moreover, it will foster trust between them and their customers by showcasing their commitment to transparency. </p>\n\n<p>People appreciate companies that are willing to admit errors and accept responsibility for making improvements. On the contrary, those who choose to sweep customer complaints under the rug risk losing credibility. By taking a proactive stance, businesses can boost their reputations and demonstrate respect for their customers.</p>\n\n<h3>Greater Brand Visibility, Thus Better Customer Relationships</h3>\n\n<p>Creating greater visibility for a brand is key to building customer relationships. By increasing visibility of the brand, customers can learn more about it, be exposed to its products and services, and grow a connection to the company. </p>\n\n<p>Utilizing various marketing strategies and channels such as social media, advertising, search engine optimization, and influencer marketing, companies can reach larger audiences and leverage relationships with their target customers. With effective communication and engaging content, a brand can create an emotional connection with its customers, build brand loyalty, and strengthen its relationships.</p>\n\n<p>That said, let us start by drawing a critical distinction between SEO and ORM. SEO (search engine optimization) is about improving rankings on search engines. It incorporates techniques like content generation, organic link building, and fixing broken links.</p>\n\n<p>ORM is about maintaining the brand reputation by managing or fixing bad reviews. You can showcase the positive aspects of your business. The same applies to capitalizing on positive customer reviews. Indeed, even keeping up with responding to negative reviews can boost brand visibility. You can push negative reviews to lower positions in search results. All you need are the right tactics.</p>\n\n<p>So what does brand visibility have to do with better customer relationships? Well, always have the following at the back of your mind:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Customers will research a brand or product online before buying. Appearing in top search results increases the chances of getting organic leads. It can also lead to more conversions.</li>\n\t<li>Appearing in the top search results signifies a trustworthy and credible company.</li>\n\t<li>Positive brand mentions are great for building trust. The chances of conversions and referrals from happy customers increase.</li>\n</ul><h3>Better Customer Management with ORM</h3>\n\n<p>ORM has more to offer the brand beyond mere reputation management. Indeed, you can better manage customers with a solid ORM strategy. </p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Prompt responses</strong> to customer concerns will always win you brownie points. Let's say a customer complains about something via your inbox or chat line. At this point, you have enough time to take proactive measures to avoid an escalation. Remember, you can turn a dissatisfied customer into a disgruntled, fire-breathing keyboard warrior. How? By ignoring them. In no time, negative reviews will be flying all over. Before you know it, the 'fires' are spreading all over the internet, especially social media.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Show <a href=\"/podcast/ivan-stegic-leading-empathy\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Ivan Stegic - Leading with empathy\">empathy</a> and care</strong> with how you handle negative reviews or comments. Every customer has some fundamental needs. And one of them is for companies they interact with to treat them well. Showing empathy removes the transactional feel from the engagement. It solidifies the fact it is not only about making money, but rather the chance to build fruitful relationships.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Address customer dissatisfaction</strong> that can result in poor press for the brand. A business fact is that you may not be able to avoid negativity in its entirety. What matters is how you respond. By now, it should be clear that ignoring unhappy customers is something you should never do. Let the customers know you hear them, and will work to resolve their issues as soon as possible. That simple act builds trust in your brand and what you have to say.</li>\n\t<li>ORM provides a chance to <strong>own up to and rectify your mistakes</strong>. It would be easy to think that customers demand perfection from brands. But that may not be the case for all customers. For sure, they want the best you can offer. Yet customers also understand human fallibility. Showing acceptance and remorse can be the difference between losing and keeping customers. Beyond that is the chance to <strong>strengthen existing relationships</strong>. You can also show transparency and build trust. Working to fix the issue proves that you are working to ensure customer satisfaction. All these factors result in better relationships with customers – customers who are likely to remain loyal to the brand for years.</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n\n<article data-align=\"center\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/medium_800/public/2023-01/orm_bp_cover-2.png?itok=AefbvZ4V\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Person on laptop with floating holographic depictions of computer files and processes\" loading=\"lazy\" /></article><p> </p>\n\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\n\n<p>ORM is an essential tactic for any digital marketer.

          "value": "<p>December was a particularly exciting month for the Drupal community, owing to the highly anticipated release of Drupal 10 and the various (in-person!) release parties. A lot of Drupal articles from last month were related to the D10 release, but our recap still includes a nice mix of various Drupal-related articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal 10.0.0 is available</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We almost have to start with the announcement of the Drupal 10 release and its new features from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gaborhojtsy\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gábor Hojtsy Twitter\">Gábor Hojtsy</a>. As usual, he first covers everything that’s new in this version: the addition of Olivero and Claro as default themes; the upgrade to CKEditor 5; removed support for IE; responsive grids in views; the Starterkit theme generator; the addition of Symfony 6.2 and PHP 8.1 as dependencies; and deprecation of outdated features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gábor’s post also includes a section about current initiatives and the future of Drupal 10, as well as the classic upgrade tips for different users and owners on websites on different Drupal versions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-10-0-0\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Drupal 10.0.0 is available\"><strong>Read more about the Drupal 10 release</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal launches Drupal 10, the latest version of the open-source digital experience platform</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the second post from last month, we have another piece about the launch of Drupal 10, this one coming from <a href=\"https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/author/royedwards/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Roy Edwards Enterprise Times\">Roy Edwards</a> and published by <a href=\"https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Enterprise Times homepage\">Enterprise Times</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like the announcement on drupal.org, Roy’s post first covers the new Drupal 10 features. Additionally, it includes thoughts from Drupal Project Lead Dries Buytaert on what they mean for Drupal at large, as well as from the Chair of the Board of the Drupal Association Baddý Sonja Breidert on Drupal’s status in the broader open-source ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final section of the post then focuses on Acquia and their biggest developments of 2022, i.e. the acquisition of the Widen DAM and the launch of the Acquia CMS Headless Starter Kit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.enterprisetimes.co.uk/2022/12/16/drupal-launches-drupal-10-the-latest-version-of-the-open-source-digital-experience-platform/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Enterprise Times: Drupal launches Drupal 10, the latest version of the open-source digital experience platform\"><strong>Read the Drupal 10 press release</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The Value of Having a Drupal.org Profile and Biography.​</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The third post comes from the prolific <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jrockowitz\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jacob Rockowitz Twitter\">Jacob Rockowitz</a>, who wrote about the value of a drupal.org profile and biography for Drupal community members, especially those who are very active contributors, like Jacob is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As he points out, the main reason for having a well thought out profile on drupal.org is the confirmation of being a true community member, with all of your past contributions and interactions listed and able to be viewed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The main part of Jacob’s post is dedicated to describing his biography on drupal.org and why in particular he chose to include certain pieces of information. Here, he also provides some tips on how to structure your own drupal.org biography and invites readers to share their thoughts on all this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/drupal-org-profile\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jrockowitz: The Value of Having a Drupal.org Profile and Biography.​\"><strong>Read more about the value of a drupal.org profile &amp; biography</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal 10 is here!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have another Drupal 10 post, written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/minneapolisdan\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dan Moriarty Twitter\">Dan Moriarty</a> of <a href=\"https://www.electriccitizen.com\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Electric Citizen homepage\">Electric Citizen</a>. The main reason why we decided to include this one is that Dan also touches upon the faster release timeline of recent versions and the reasons behind it in addition to providing an overview of the new features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The number one reason for shorter time spans between major releases is Drupal’s new stance on backward compatibility and the focus on streamlining the upgrade path. The second key reason is the dependencies which recently reached end of life status, most importantly version 4 of the Symfony framework which Drupal 8 is based on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.electriccitizen.com/citizen-blog/drupal-10-here\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Electric Citizen: Drupal 10 is here!\"><strong>Read more about Drupal 10 and the Drupal release timeline</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bug Smash: Taking a community initiative from idea to success</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we have a post by <a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au/about/team/griffynheels\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Griffyn Heels PreviousNext\">Griffyn Heels</a> of <a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext homepage\">PreviousNext</a> about the Bug Smash community initiative, based on his talk from DrupalSouth 2022. Bug Smash is an initiative consisting of almost 500 community members working on around 6000 active issues for Drupal 9 and 10.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Griffyn also explains in more detail the different initiative processes, i.e. the daily triage target, the community triage meeting, and the fortnightly initiative meeting.

With so much time being spent on the internet, we understand that in this global village, we all depend on each other — especially businesses and consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Businesses have decided to move their operations from brick-and-mortar business models to online ones. And even physical companies have become mindful of their online presence. In today's world, a <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/theyec/2020/02/03/why-every-business-needs-a-website/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Forbes: Why Every Business Needs a Website\">website is essential for every organization</a>. A business without a website may miss out on many potential opportunities and customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you want your business to grow, you need to understand that enterprises accomplish a lot with various digital marketing strategies. Web advertising has reached new highs and has become one of the most effective marketing techniques. What makes it even better is the feasibility of building websites and the number of various attractive themes out there. All the reasons a business should own a website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the many benefits, a website can help businesses offer brand awareness and visibility to their potential customers. This eventually drives more customers to their business, helping them create a solid customer base.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Importance of Content Marketing for Brand Awareness&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Content marketing significantly influences organic traffic toward your website and can beat the drum of brand awareness for your business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A robust <a href=\"https://contentmarketing.io/digital-content-strategy/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Content Marketing: Effective Digital Content Strategy – 10 Hacks\">content strategy</a> needs to have at least two components. Firstly, it should get your brand name out and display it across platforms. Moreover, it should bring organic traffic to your website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A solid content marketing strategy provides:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Increase in social media followers&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Referral traffic from social media toward the website</li>\r\n\t<li>Build strategic brand partnership&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Drives organic traffic to the website&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Earning high-authority backlinks&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Improving customer retention gradually</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And these are only to name a few of the benefits that encourage brand visibility through content strategy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But how do you make the content work to help you gain visibility through your website? To make your content work for you, here's what you need to do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Understand Your Target Customers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The people who are most interested in your products and services are your target customers. Often, most of them have similar characteristics, such as gender, age, or interests. To determine a selling point that stands out, you need to know these characteristics.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once evaluated, you will know who your potential buyers will be. You can also check out your competitor’s audience and notice their similarities and differences to understand your audience better. Other than that, your business needs to stand out against your competitors. You will compare your target audience with theirs, and if it's similar, you will bring forward an <a href=\"/blog/how-foster-innovation-focused-company-culture\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How to foster an innovation-focused company culture\">innovative selling point</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With insights, you can strategize the perfect content marketing strategy that will allow your business to be visible to your target audience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Build Your Website</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>To boost your online presence, you must design your website a certain way. As mentioned before, a website offers business visibility and credibility. Your website gives you the power and complete freedom to mold your brand’s online persona. The way you set up your website plays a huge role. Thankfully, it's straightforward to set up a website. You would need the following:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Web Hosting Provider</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>To make your website accessible on the internet, you need a web host. It would be best if you had a trusted web hosting provider who is reliable enough to offer you website security and availability. Be mindful of your website requirements and aims, and pick a suitable web hosting provider.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don't want to worry about your website traffic going overboard over the bandwidth limits — leading to a decrease in page load time, then you should opt for an unlimited web hosting plan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With unlimited bandwidth, you can also publish diversified website content without a hassle. A fast website that is engaging for visitors will make them stay on your website and explore your products and services, and ultimately this is how you gain brand visibility.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Domain Name</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The access to your website, which you enter in the browser address bar, is your domain name. A short, simple, and to-the-point domain name stays memorable and is easy for people to remember and look back at. It is the way your business will be recognized on the web.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A domain name has three fundamental parts:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Subdomain –&nbsp;for example, “www”</li>\r\n\t<li>Second Level Domain (SLD) –&nbsp;most often, the name of the brand</li>\r\n\t<li>Top Level Domain (TLD) – for example, ‘.com’, ‘.org&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>And, you need to consider every part to get the best out of your domain name. So, how should you choose the perfect one? Keep these points in mind.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Choosing SLDs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Your domain name or <a href=\"https://www.domain.com/blog/what-is-a-second-level-domain/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Domain: What is a Second Level Domain?\">Second Level Domain (SLD)</a> should be the same as your brand's name because that will make it easier for others to remember it. So, first, check whether the concerned domain name is available.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this purpose, use an online domain availability checker, such as NameCheap, Godaddy, Name.com, etc. Simply type the intended domain name in the search bar, and check their available options.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Be Careful with TLDs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>If the intended option is already taken, you can go through the list of alternatives that may have the same domain name but different top-level domains (TLD). These are further segregated into:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>gTLDs (Generic Top-level Domains) – for example, <em>.com</em>, <em>.org</em>, <em>.net</em></li>\r\n\t<li>ccTLDs (Country-code Top-level Domains) – for example, <em>.us</em>, <em>.uk</em>, <em>.in</em></li>\r\n\t<li>sTLDs (Sponsored Top-level Domains) – for example, <em>.gov</em>, <em>.edu</em></li>\r\n\t<li>Infrastructure top-level domains.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts recommend going with gTLDs as users find them safe. In fact, the ‘<em>.com</em>’ TLD is associated with <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/265677/number-of-internet-top-level-domains-worldwide/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Statista: Most popular TLDs worldwide 2022\">more than 50% of the websites</a>, followed by ‘<em>.org</em>’ with a 4.4% market share. And if you’re targeting a specific country or region, you can choose a ccTLD of that country.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>For Subdomain</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As far as your subdomain is concerned, you can have the “www” subdomain for the main page so that customers can find you easily. To distinguish your product pages from information-based pages, you can use a distinguished subdomain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if you have a blog, you can have the domain, “<strong>blog.yourwebsitename.com</strong>”. Or if there are too many products or services, you can opt for a separate subdomain, such as “<strong>service.yourwebsitename.com</strong>” &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Website-Building Platform</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular website builders offer limited functionality and customization. With such tools, your website would look bare and very similar to many other websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a content management system (CMS), you have more control and flexibility on your website. <a href=\"/enterprise-wordpress-development\" title=\"Agiledrop: Enterprise WordPress development\">WordPress</a> is a widely-used CMS, and it offers plenty of themes and customization options; on top of that, it’s effortless to set up as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter which option you opt for, you must make sure that the website design stands out.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving forward, you need to keep in mind the following things to provide a better user experience (UX) to your customers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Stay simple. Be mindful of keeping your layout clean and easy to navigate. Do not stuff too much information on home pages.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Never use below-par image quality. High-quality images produce a professional look on the website.</li>\r\n\t<li>Be consistent. Whether it is color schemes or typography, ensure you incorporate the same elements throughout your website.</li>\r\n\t<li>Think about mobile-friendly design. More people use their mobile phones to visit websites. Ensure the website looks attractive and is responsive on all devices, such as tablets and phones.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>When you make your website <a href=\"/blog/7-reasons-why-accessibility-good-business\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 7 reasons why accessibility is good for business\">accessible</a> for all and build it with a user-friendly interface, you are most likely to gain the brand visibility that you are looking for.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Offer High-Quality and Valuable Content</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>It is vital to keep your audience in mind when creating content. Focus on your customers’ pain points and address them through your content. Using relevant keywords would also help you rank well on search engine results pages (SERPs).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides that, you must keep your content original, accurate, true to fact, well-researched, and error-free. This way, you can display your professionalism and expertise to your customers, improving brand visibility online through your website.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avoid duplicate content, and experiment with different content types to see which ones your audience engages with the most. For example, if podcasts work for your website, and written content doesn't get much traffic, you should increase the number of times you publish <a href=\"/blog/top-8-digital-business-podcasts-follow-2022\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Top 8 digital business podcasts to follow in 2022\">podcasts</a>. Read ahead to learn about the types of content you can offer your audience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Different Kinds of Website Content</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, it may be hard to pick the kind of content that will resonate with ​​your audience. You may want to create a combination of different content forms (text and visuals) and experiment with different combinations to see which combination gets better results.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the trial and error phase, you will finally find out which content has the most impact on your audience and your business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your content needs to <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-lifelong-relationship-with-content-marketing/398659\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Entrepreneur: How to Build Lifelong Relationship With Content Marketing\">communicate your business values</a> to your customers. You can make use of the following content types on your website to explain them to your audience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Blogs</li>\r\n\t<li>Videos</li>\r\n\t<li>Podcasts</li>\r\n\t<li>Infographics&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Live videos</li>\r\n\t<li>Interviews&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Guest posts</li>\r\n\t<li>Tutorials</li>\r\n\t<li>Whitepapers</li>\r\n\t<li>Hosted events&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>With time, the results will show on your analytics report which types of content your website visitors liked most. This will give you a strong direction of which content you should post often and which content less regularly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Streamline Your SEO</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Conduct keyword research and make sure to optimize your website with relevant keywords. However, be careful not to overdo it. Google algorithms consider keyword-stuffing or over-optimization as ‘gaming’ tactics – and tend to penalize such websites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More importantly, optimize the following:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The draft&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Alt text&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Page titles&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Meta description&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>This is called search engine optimization (SEO) and helps your business website rank better on search engines such as Google.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also find keywords on Google Trends and through Google’s autocompleting feature. SEO plugins also help to keep your content optimized by providing on-page suggestions and other features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Use Effective Marketing Strategies</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>No marketing strategy is a one-size-fits-all solution for your business, but the following are general rules of thumb you can adapt and grow from.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Be clear about your goals. Using <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Atlassian: How to write SMART goals\">SMART goals</a>, create campaigns that have a specific aim – for example, increasing your brand visibility by 50% in the next six months.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Your marketing needs to craft messages that can resonate with ​​your audience and understand.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Select key marketing channels that suit your business best. For this purpose, you need to know where your audience is located.</li>\r\n\t<li>Data analysis tools like Google Trends, Ahref, Moz, etc., can help you find out your target audience across different social platforms, saving you ample time in choosing the right marketing channels.&nbsp;</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Apart from the above, always check your efforts on analytics to make sure that you are reaching your goals or if you need to make improvements.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"9ba8d781-2f78-40ef-8ccf-3a5545ec4004\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>FAQs&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>Q.

All the reasons a business should own a website.</p>\n\n<p>Among the many benefits, a website can help businesses offer brand awareness and visibility to their potential customers. This eventually drives more customers to their business, helping them create a solid customer base. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Importance of Content Marketing for Brand Awareness </h2>\n\n<p>Content marketing significantly influences organic traffic toward your website and can beat the drum of brand awareness for your business. </p>\n\n<p>A robust <a href=\"https://contentmarketing.io/digital-content-strategy/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Content Marketing: Effective Digital Content Strategy – 10 Hacks\">content strategy</a> needs to have at least two components. Firstly, it should get your brand name out and display it across platforms. Moreover, it should bring organic traffic to your website. </p>\n\n<p>A solid content marketing strategy provides: </p>\n\n<ul><li>Increase in social media followers </li>\n\t<li>Referral traffic from social media toward the website</li>\n\t<li>Build strategic brand partnership </li>\n\t<li>Drives organic traffic to the website </li>\n\t<li>Earning high-authority backlinks </li>\n\t<li>Improving customer retention gradually</li>\n</ul><p>And these are only to name a few of the benefits that encourage brand visibility through content strategy. </p>\n\n<p>But how do you make the content work to help you gain visibility through your website? To make your content work for you, here's what you need to do. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>1. Understand Your Target Customers</h2>\n\n<p>The people who are most interested in your products and services are your target customers. Often, most of them have similar characteristics, such as gender, age, or interests. To determine a selling point that stands out, you need to know these characteristics. </p>\n\n<p>Once evaluated, you will know who your potential buyers will be. You can also check out your competitor’s audience and notice their similarities and differences to understand your audience better. Other than that, your business needs to stand out against your competitors. You will compare your target audience with theirs, and if it's similar, you will bring forward an <a href=\"/blog/how-foster-innovation-focused-company-culture\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How to foster an innovation-focused company culture\">innovative selling point</a>. </p>\n\n<p>With insights, you can strategize the perfect content marketing strategy that will allow your business to be visible to your target audience. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>2. Build Your Website</h2>\n\n<p>To boost your online presence, you must design your website a certain way. As mentioned before, a website offers business visibility and credibility. Your website gives you the power and complete freedom to mold your brand’s online persona. The way you set up your website plays a huge role. Thankfully, it's straightforward to set up a website. You would need the following: </p>\n\n<h3>Web Hosting Provider</h3>\n\n<p>To make your website accessible on the internet, you need a web host. It would be best if you had a trusted web hosting provider who is reliable enough to offer you website security and availability. Be mindful of your website requirements and aims, and pick a suitable web hosting provider.</p>\n\n<p>If you don't want to worry about your website traffic going overboard over the bandwidth limits — leading to a decrease in page load time, then you should opt for an unlimited web hosting plan. </p>\n\n<p>With unlimited bandwidth, you can also publish diversified website content without a hassle. A fast website that is engaging for visitors will make them stay on your website and explore your products and services, and ultimately this is how you gain brand visibility. </p>\n\n<h3>Domain Name</h3>\n\n<p>The access to your website, which you enter in the browser address bar, is your domain name. A short, simple, and to-the-point domain name stays memorable and is easy for people to remember and look back at. It is the way your business will be recognized on the web. </p>\n\n<p>A domain name has three fundamental parts:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Subdomain – for example, “www”</li>\n\t<li>Second Level Domain (SLD) – most often, the name of the brand</li>\n\t<li>Top Level Domain (TLD) – for example, ‘.com’, ‘.org </li>\n</ul><p>And, you need to consider every part to get the best out of your domain name. So, how should you choose the perfect one? Keep these points in mind. </p>\n\n<h3>Choosing SLDs</h3>\n\n<p>Your domain name or <a href=\"https://www.domain.com/blog/what-is-a-second-level-domain/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Domain: What is a Second Level Domain?\">Second Level Domain (SLD)</a> should be the same as your brand's name because that will make it easier for others to remember it. So, first, check whether the concerned domain name is available. </p>\n\n<p>For this purpose, use an online domain availability checker, such as NameCheap, Godaddy, Name.com, etc. Simply type the intended domain name in the search bar, and check their available options. </p>\n\n<h3>Be Careful with TLDs</h3>\n\n<p>If the intended option is already taken, you can go through the list of alternatives that may have the same domain name but different top-level domains (TLD). These are further segregated into:</p>\n\n<ul><li>gTLDs (Generic Top-level Domains) – for example, <em>.com</em>, <em>.org</em>, <em>.net</em></li>\n\t<li>ccTLDs (Country-code Top-level Domains) – for example, <em>.us</em>, <em>.uk</em>, <em>.in</em></li>\n\t<li>sTLDs (Sponsored Top-level Domains) – for example, <em>.gov</em>, <em>.edu</em></li>\n\t<li>Infrastructure top-level domains. </li>\n</ul><p>Experts recommend going with gTLDs as users find them safe. In fact, the ‘<em>.com</em>’ TLD is associated with <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/265677/number-of-internet-top-level-domains-worldwide/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Statista: Most popular TLDs worldwide 2022\">more than 50% of the websites</a>, followed by ‘<em>.org</em>’ with a 4.4% market share. And if you’re targeting a specific country or region, you can choose a ccTLD of that country.</p>\n\n<h3>For Subdomain</h3>\n\n<p>As far as your subdomain is concerned, you can have the “www” subdomain for the main page so that customers can find you easily. To distinguish your product pages from information-based pages, you can use a distinguished subdomain.</p>\n\n<p>For example, if you have a blog, you can have the domain, “<strong>blog.yourwebsitename.com</strong>”. Or if there are too many products or services, you can opt for a separate subdomain, such as “<strong>service.yourwebsitename.com</strong>”  </p>\n\n<h3>Website-Building Platform</h3>\n\n<p>Regular website builders offer limited functionality and customization. With such tools, your website would look bare and very similar to many other websites.</p>\n\n<p>With a content management system (CMS), you have more control and flexibility on your website. <a href=\"/enterprise-wordpress-development\" title=\"Agiledrop: Enterprise WordPress development\">WordPress</a> is a widely-used CMS, and it offers plenty of themes and customization options; on top of that, it’s effortless to set up as well.</p>\n\n<p>No matter which option you opt for, you must make sure that the website design stands out. </p>\n\n<p>Moving forward, you need to keep in mind the following things to provide a better user experience (UX) to your customers. </p>\n\n<ul><li>Stay simple. Be mindful of keeping your layout clean and easy to navigate. Do not stuff too much information on home pages. </li>\n\t<li>Never use below-par image quality. High-quality images produce a professional look on the website.</li>\n\t<li>Be consistent. Whether it is color schemes or typography, ensure you incorporate the same elements throughout your website.</li>\n\t<li>Think about mobile-friendly design. More people use their mobile phones to visit websites. Ensure the website looks attractive and is responsive on all devices, such as tablets and phones. </li>\n</ul><p>When you make your website <a href=\"/blog/7-reasons-why-accessibility-good-business\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 7 reasons why accessibility is good for business\">accessible</a> for all and build it with a user-friendly interface, you are most likely to gain the brand visibility that you are looking for. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>3. Offer High-Quality and Valuable Content</h2>\n\n<p>It is vital to keep your audience in mind when creating content. Focus on your customers’ pain points and address them through your content. Using relevant keywords would also help you rank well on search engine results pages (SERPs). </p>\n\n<p>Besides that, you must keep your content original, accurate, true to fact, well-researched, and error-free. This way, you can display your professionalism and expertise to your customers, improving brand visibility online through your website. </p>\n\n<p>Avoid duplicate content, and experiment with different content types to see which ones your audience engages with the most. For example, if podcasts work for your website, and written content doesn't get much traffic, you should increase the number of times you publish <a href=\"/blog/top-8-digital-business-podcasts-follow-2022\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Top 8 digital business podcasts to follow in 2022\">podcasts</a>. Read ahead to learn about the types of content you can offer your audience. </p>\n\n<h3>Different Kinds of Website Content</h3>\n\n<p>Initially, it may be hard to pick the kind of content that will resonate with ​​your audience. You may want to create a combination of different content forms (text and visuals) and experiment with different combinations to see which combination gets better results. </p>\n\n<p>After the trial and error phase, you will finally find out which content has the most impact on your audience and your business. </p>\n\n<p>Your content needs to <a href=\"https://www.entrepreneur.com/growing-a-business/how-to-build-lifelong-relationship-with-content-marketing/398659\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Entrepreneur: How to Build Lifelong Relationship With Content Marketing\">communicate your business values</a> to your customers. You can make use of the following content types on your website to explain them to your audience. </p>\n\n<ul><li>Blogs</li>\n\t<li>Videos</li>\n\t<li>Podcasts</li>\n\t<li>Infographics </li>\n\t<li>Live videos</li>\n\t<li>Interviews </li>\n\t<li>Guest posts</li>\n\t<li>Tutorials</li>\n\t<li>Whitepapers</li>\n\t<li>Hosted events </li>\n</ul><p>With time, the results will show on your analytics report which types of content your website visitors liked most. This will give you a strong direction of which content you should post often and which content less regularly. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>4. Streamline Your SEO</h2>\n\n<p>Conduct keyword research and make sure to optimize your website with relevant keywords. However, be careful not to overdo it. Google algorithms consider keyword-stuffing or over-optimization as ‘gaming’ tactics – and tend to penalize such websites. </p>\n\n<p>More importantly, optimize the following: </p>\n\n<ul><li>The draft </li>\n\t<li>Alt text </li>\n\t<li>Page titles </li>\n\t<li>Meta description </li>\n</ul><p>This is called search engine optimization (SEO) and helps your business website rank better on search engines such as Google. </p>\n\n<p>You can also find keywords on Google Trends and through Google’s autocompleting feature. SEO plugins also help to keep your content optimized by providing on-page suggestions and other features. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>5. Use Effective Marketing Strategies</h2>\n\n<p>No marketing strategy is a one-size-fits-all solution for your business, but the following are general rules of thumb you can adapt and grow from. </p>\n\n<ul><li>Be clear about your goals. Using <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/blog/productivity/how-to-write-smart-goals\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Atlassian: How to write SMART goals\">SMART goals</a>, create campaigns that have a specific aim – for example, increasing your brand visibility by 50% in the next six months. </li>\n\t<li>Your marketing needs to craft messages that can resonate with ​​your audience and understand. </li>\n\t<li>Select key marketing channels that suit your business best. For this purpose, you need to know where your audience is located.</li>\n\t<li>Data analysis tools like Google Trends, Ahref, Moz, etc., can help you find out your target audience across different social platforms, saving you ample time in choosing the right marketing channels. </li>\n</ul><p>Apart from the above, always check your efforts on analytics to make sure that you are reaching your goals or if you need to make improvements. </p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<article data-align=\"center\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/medium_800/public/2023-01/website_bp_final.png?itok=2NeVZalJ\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Digital metrics overlaid over photo of city in the sun\" loading=\"lazy\" /></article><p> </p>\n\n<h2>FAQs </h2>\n\n<h3>Q.

In this article, we’ll go through 5 key areas of a website/digital strategy you should focus on; let’s get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data strategy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Data is the driving force behind exceptional digital experiences, but there is a big conflict between the need for more and better data on the one hand, and <a href=\"/blog/walking-privacy-walk\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Walking the privacy walk\">privacy</a> concerns and regulations on the other.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the ways tech giants are tackling this problem is to rely less and less on the use of third-party cookies, which <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/google-delays-phasing-out-ad-cookies-on-chrome-until-2024\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bloomberg: Google Delays Phasing Out Ad Cookies on Chrome Until 2024\">Google plans to phase out in 2024</a>. This means it’s high time businesses start to implement other strategies for learning about their customers’ preferences, and the best approach here is to develop a first-party data strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First-party data is freely given by your users/customers (through surveys, contact forms, social media interactions, etc.), and it can often be much more informative than third-party data, especially if you’re able to use it well. Best of all, it allows you to keep creating relevant customer experiences while also respecting the customers’ privacy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another priority for your 2023 data strategy should be revisiting your data analytics platforms, i.e.:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Have you already upgraded from Universal Analytics to Google Analytics 4?</strong> <a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/11583528\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Google Analytics Help: Universal Analytics will be going away\">From July 2023, UA will no longer be processing new hits</a>, so you’ll need to upgrade to GA4 by then if you wish to continue getting relevant data from Google Analytics.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Are you using a CRM/CDP for collecting and managing customer data?</strong> Make sure whichever ones you’re using are kept up to date and well connected with your other platforms to prevent data siloing.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Content audit</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, data’s key role is fueling the most essential part of digital experiences – content. As you prepare your <a href=\"/podcast/baddy-sonja-breidert-content-strategy\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Baddý Sonja Breidert - Content strategy\">content strategy</a> for the new year, it’s wise to do a content audit to best gauge what has and hasn’t worked this past year, and how to streamline your content for the next.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here you should cover two aspects:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Content strategy:</strong> revisit your content strategy to determine where your focus should be in the year ahead. Review (un)successful content types, check your best performing pieces of content, reflect on the most memorable customer interactions and what kind of content resonated with them – here you can also check if your audiences and/or their habits have changed.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>SEO strategy:</strong> since search engine optimization is a constant race, you should refresh it at least once a year, and what better time to do it than at the beginning of the year. Redo competitor analysis, review your keywords and combine all that with efforts covered in the previous point to maximize the search engine performance of your content going into 2023.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>UX audit</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, having great content is important, but how much can it really benefit you if your customers can’t access it, or are having a frustrating experience accessing it? To prevent such scenarios as much as possible, take the time to do a user experience audit now – if you’ll be adding out new content types and trying out new strategies, chances are high in any case that you’ll run into additional UX challenges, so a UX audit will be pretty much unavoidable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The three primary considerations here should be:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Core Web Vitals:</strong> these are Google’s most important factor for determining the quality of a webpage’s UX, which also heavily affects search engine rankings – meaning you should also keep this top of mind for the SEO part of the audit discussed above.&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> by now you’ve already had to take care of your website’s <a href=\"/blog/7-reasons-why-accessibility-good-business\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 7 reasons why accessibility is good for business\">accessibility</a>, and if you do a thorough UX audit you’ll have uncovered most of the outstanding accessibility issues. Still, it’s an essential aspect of a website’s usability, and so it’s wise to double check for any potential issues you might have missed, especially when it comes to page elements such as forms, which are key for any B2B site but also very prone to a11y issues.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Mobile:</strong> more and more people are not only accessing content on their mobile phones, but also purchasing products directly through the smartphone. So, having your website function optimally on mobile is no longer a nice to have, but a must have. If you’re performing any other software and/or content updates, you’ll particularly need to check if any of these affect the experience on mobile and ensure your design stays responsive.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Software updates</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important step in ensuring your website stays performant throughout 2023 is checking for any new software updates or, even more importantly, potential deprecations.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, version 7 of the PHP programming language reached its end of life on November 28, making now the perfect time for owners of websites built on PHP or a PHP-based CMS such as <a href=\"/drupal\" title=\"Agiledrop: Drupal development\">Drupal</a> to plan how and when to upgrade.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determine what it would take to have your website stay up to date with its core technologies:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Is there a new software version available?</strong> If your website runs on Drupal, check if it’s eligible for an upgrade to the recently released <a href=\"/blog/drupal-10-refresh-leading-cms-new-generation-users\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Drupal 10 – a refresh of the leading CMS for a new generation of users\">version 10</a> which also has full support for PHP 8.x.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>(When) do you need to upgrade?</strong> If the latest version doesn’t bring any new features you intend to use and/or staying on the current one poses no security risks, you can safely prioritize other aspects of your website strategy before committing to an upgrade, especially if you know it will be a complex one.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Will you need custom development?</strong> If you determine that upgrading should be a top priority, check how much you can automate versus what will require custom development. In case you need some extra development capacity, <a href=\"/get-developers\" title=\"Agiledrop: Get developers\">check out how our team can help you out</a>.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Channel strategy</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This final point isn’t focused exclusively on the website, but rather treats it as a central content hub for your <a href=\"/blog/digital-strategy-omnichannel-digital-experiences\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Digital strategy for omnichannel digital experiences\">digital strategy</a>. As such, a crucial step in streamlining your website for 2023 is also determining how it can best serve this overarching digital strategy by having its content reach your target audience however and wherever it resonates with them the most.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Review your current channels together with the relevant customer data to determine:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>What channels have been on the rise among your target audience and how can you tap into them?</strong> For example, have you noticed an uptick in engagement on a social media platform you haven’t yet focused on? Or perhaps so many of your customers access your B2C website on mobile that you’ve decided you need a mobile app? This part of the audit will help you plan how to customize your site and its content management processes to best fit any new channel you prioritize in 2023.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Are there any channels that are no longer working for you?</strong> If so, review how much it still makes sense to focus on them and whether a better move would be to invest in the new channels you’ve uncovered instead.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"d0caf921-fa7f-4581-b8ad-abe48578ab80\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>The digital world moves so fast that it’s become a must to regularly refresh your website in order to keep it relevant to your customers.

Many developers are using AI to build applications that can act like intelligent agents and help you accomplish tasks more efficiently. However, if you’re a marketer or customer service representative, chances are that you don’t have much knowledge about AI. So what exactly is artificial intelligence? What can it do for your business? And how will it affect digital experiences? If you want answers to these questions, read on!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Digital experience platforms</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Digital experience platforms (DXPs) are the future of online. They will help with personalization, customer experience, marketing and data.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DXPs will help you understand your customers better so you can create better interactions with them. You'll be able to see what they do on your website or app and how they interact with it so that you can personalize the experience based on their preferences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use of AI in business applications</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AI is becoming an increasingly important part of business applications.&nbsp;AI is being used for tasks like customer service, marketing, and sales. AI can help businesses understand their customers and employees better by providing insights into data. AI can also help companies improve their products through machine learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AI is going to be a key part of DXPs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AI can deliver personalized experiences, content personalization, and customer service, as well as help with marketing, analytics, and automating processes. In addition, it brings many benefits with regards to security, risk management, and compliance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AI can help the DXP to make better decisions, predict what will happen next, or find solutions to problems it encounters. It can also automate processes and tasks that would otherwise be done by humans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Personalization is key for DXPs</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AI is going to be essential for <a href=\"/blog/finding-balance-personalization\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Finding the balance with personalization\">personalization</a> in DXPs, and it's something we're already seeing today. Personalization can be based on user behavior, on a user profile (such as location), or on the preferences of the user.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let's look at an example of what this might look like in practice: you're browsing your favorite retail website looking for a new pair of shoes, but all you see are sneakers. You decide you want a pair that has more support for running but still looks good with your favorite jeans—so you enter \"running sneakers\" into the search bar and get back results that match your query but also include some additional information about prices and availability in nearby stores etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This type of personalization can help make websites more useful by serving up relevant information without forcing visitors through hoops such as clicking through links within each page before finding what they need—which may be especially important if people aren't familiar with how websites work yet (e.g., someone visiting their first site ever).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AI is making it easier to understand audience behavior</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AI can help marketers understand what content is popular and why, which allows them to be more strategic in their marketing efforts. For example, if a piece of content is really well received by your audience then you should consider creating more pieces like that. On the other hand, if a piece of content isn't as well received by your audience then you don't want to create more like it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AI also provides an opportunity for marketers to understand why certain strategies work or don't work. This means they can learn from previous mistakes and improve upon current approaches in order to make sure they're reaching the right people with their messaging at the right time in order to get results from their campaigns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>AI helps improve customer experience on websites</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Customer experience is the key to success in the digital world. The more satisfying your website is for customers, the better their experience will be and the more likely they are to return. AI helps improve customer experience by enabling you to:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Provide better customer service by understanding what customers want when they talk about their needs or problems with AI-powered chatbots that respond in real time.</li>\r\n\t<li>Personalize content for each user based on preferences and behaviors, adding a personal touch at scale.</li>\r\n\t<li>Optimize marketing campaigns so that you can reach the right audience with well-timed offers and messages.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Data will help AI get smarter every day</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AI is <a href=\"/podcast/julio-e-proano-data-driven-decision-making-digital-strategy\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Julio E. Proano - Data-driven decision making in a digital strategy\">data-driven</a>; it learns from the past and present.&nbsp;The more data you feed to your AI system, the smarter it gets. And that's not only true for training AI models on your own data—it also applies to other AI systems as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you're using an open-source model, there are other AIs out there that will have learned from some of your users' behavior too! This means that if you've trained a specific model in one app and want to use it in another, all those learnings from your users will be available for use as well—no need for retraining or starting again from scratch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is what's known as transfer learning. Transfer learning is when a machine learns from one set of data and applies it to another, similar task. It allows us to reap the benefits of having trained models without needing to start over every time we want to use them in different contexts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Marketing and customer service applications will be the biggest beneficiaries of AI innovations in coming years</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>AI is already being used to improve personalization in the B2C world; one of the best-known examples is Amazon’s recommendation engine which suggests products based on your past purchases. But AI will soon be able to take this one step further by recommending specific items based on a combination of factors including your past buying history, but also what other people with similar interests have bought as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, AI will be used to improve customer experience by making interactions more efficient and effective. For example, chatbots are already being deployed within most businesses today – they can answer basic questions about products or services, provide product information (including prices), process orders and payments and alert customers when an order has shipped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, these existing chatbots can only do so much with their limited set of capabilities today; tomorrow’s chatbots will be able to offer up customized recommendations based on each individual user’s preferences and purchase history—so if you buy a new pair of shoes one week and then return them two weeks later because they weren’t quite right for you then you won't get recommended those same shoes again next time around!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AI will also be used extensively across digital marketing campaigns over the next few years—from improving performance reporting through better attribution modeling by machine learning algorithms which analyze click data; understanding consumer behavior patterns across social media channels using natural language processing techniques; optimizing ad spend through predictive analytics models which automate campaign planning processes etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"fdb23a03-9ed3-4bf1-b88a-e867ffaabe2a\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of AI is bright, and we expect to see the technology becoming more sophisticated over time. It has the potential to transform businesses, but it also means that marketers will have to adapt their approach in order to not just survive but thrive in an increasingly competitive landscape.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>No matter what happens next however, there are a few things we can be sure about: DXPs will continue growing as more companies recognize their value for improving customer experience online; data will only become more important as we move towards an era where AI does most of the decision making; and digital experiences will remain at the forefront of innovation because they’re so closely linked with <a href=\"/podcast/heather-smith-intersection-humanity-human-emotion-technology\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Heather Smith - Intersection of humanity &amp; human emotion with technology\">human emotions</a>!</p>\r\n",

She then continues with the more fleshed out Drupal concepts, detailing how to use each one in a design system. These primarily include blocks, but also menus, views, paragraphs, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In her final thoughts, Monet highlights the importance of being in tune with the client’s needs and well synchronized with the Drupal development team in order for the design to be successful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://sparkbox.com/foundry/designing_for_drupal_a_shared_vocabulary_for_designers_collaborating_with_drupal_developers\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sparkbox: Designing for Drupal\"><strong>Read more about designing for Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A minimal and fast&nbsp;Drupal environment&nbsp;(part 2)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have the second article from&nbsp;a two-part series written by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/colorfield\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Christophe Jossart Twitter\">Christophe Jossart / Colorfield</a> about how to easily set up a minimal and performant Drupal 9 environment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While part one focused on the setup of a very basic development environment suited for prototyping or proof of concepts, part two goes into greater detail, and includes things such as switching between different PHP versions, and working with Solr, Xdebug, etc.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final section of the article also covers some of the most commonly encountered pitfalls, such as images not getting displayed properly, or when to use Apache versus Nginx.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://colorfield.be/blog/minimal-and-fast-drupal-environment-part-2\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Colorfield: A minimal and fast Drupal environment (part 2)\"><strong>Read more about setting up a minimal Drupal environment</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Recoupling a Decoupled Site</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve read, featured and written great articles about decoupled Drupal, which is precisely why we wanted to include this one by <a href=\"https://chromatichq.com\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chromatic homepage\">Chromatic</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markdorison\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mark Dorison Twitter\">Mark Dorison</a> which adopts the completely inverse perspective and takes a look at circumstances in which you would want to recouple a decoupled website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mark highlights three main cases where recoupling makes sense: the benefit of the decoupled website is no longer clear; the API is only used to serve the front end rather than to distribute content across channels; the maintenance of two decoupled apps requires too much time and effort.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://chromatichq.com/insights/recoupling-drupal/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chromatic: Recoupling a Decoupled Site\">Read more about recoupling a decoupled website</a></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5 Top Tips to Securing Your Drupal Website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The last post from November is provided by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeatherMilly\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Heather Hawkins Twitter\">Heather Hawkins</a> of <a href=\"https://ixis.co.uk\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ixis homepage\">Ixis</a> who breaks down 5 top tips for making sure a Drupal website is secure. While Drupal has a reputation for being quite a secure CMS out of the box, there are certain types of attacks that the platform is more vulnerable to, and hence it makes sense to take some additional security measures.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The top tips Heather highlights are as follows: making use of Drupal’s core security features; leveraging roles and permissions; having a well-thought out password policy; limiting the number of login attempts; using two- or multi-factor authentication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://ixis.co.uk/blog/5-top-tips-securing-your-drupal-website\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ixis: 5 Top Tips to Securing Your Drupal Website\"><strong>Read more about securing a Drupal website</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"f60f3c33-53fb-444a-8717-a9e29c397d0d\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p><em>If you enjoyed this selection of Drupal articles, make sure to tune in for more content on Drupal, agency business and digital strategy that we regularly post here on our blog.</em></p>\r\n",

These primarily include blocks, but also menus, views, paragraphs, etc.</p>\n\n<p>In her final thoughts, Monet highlights the importance of being in tune with the client’s needs and well synchronized with the Drupal development team in order for the design to be successful.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://sparkbox.com/foundry/designing_for_drupal_a_shared_vocabulary_for_designers_collaborating_with_drupal_developers\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sparkbox: Designing for Drupal\"><strong>Read more about designing for Drupal</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>A minimal and fast Drupal environment (part 2)</h3>\n\n<p>Moving on, we have the second article from a two-part series written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/colorfield\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Christophe Jossart Twitter\">Christophe Jossart / Colorfield</a> about how to easily set up a minimal and performant Drupal 9 environment. </p>\n\n<p>While part one focused on the setup of a very basic development environment suited for prototyping or proof of concepts, part two goes into greater detail, and includes things such as switching between different PHP versions, and working with Solr, Xdebug, etc. </p>\n\n<p>The final section of the article also covers some of the most commonly encountered pitfalls, such as images not getting displayed properly, or when to use Apache versus Nginx.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://colorfield.be/blog/minimal-and-fast-drupal-environment-part-2\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Colorfield: A minimal and fast Drupal environment (part 2)\"><strong>Read more about setting up a minimal Drupal environment</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Recoupling a Decoupled Site</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve read, featured and written great articles about decoupled Drupal, which is precisely why we wanted to include this one by <a href=\"https://chromatichq.com\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chromatic homepage\">Chromatic</a>’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/markdorison\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mark Dorison Twitter\">Mark Dorison</a> which adopts the completely inverse perspective and takes a look at circumstances in which you would want to recouple a decoupled website.</p>\n\n<p>Mark highlights three main cases where recoupling makes sense: the benefit of the decoupled website is no longer clear; the API is only used to serve the front end rather than to distribute content across channels; the maintenance of two decoupled apps requires too much time and effort.</p>\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://chromatichq.com/insights/recoupling-drupal/\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Chromatic: Recoupling a Decoupled Site\">Read more about recoupling a decoupled website</a></strong></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>5 Top Tips to Securing Your Drupal Website</h3>\n\n<p>The last post from November is provided by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HeatherMilly\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Heather Hawkins Twitter\">Heather Hawkins</a> of <a href=\"https://ixis.co.uk\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ixis homepage\">Ixis</a> who breaks down 5 top tips for making sure a Drupal website is secure. While Drupal has a reputation for being quite a secure CMS out of the box, there are certain types of attacks that the platform is more vulnerable to, and hence it makes sense to take some additional security measures.</p>\n\n<p>The top tips Heather highlights are as follows: making use of Drupal’s core security features; leveraging roles and permissions; having a well-thought out password policy; limiting the number of login attempts; using two- or multi-factor authentication.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://ixis.co.uk/blog/5-top-tips-securing-your-drupal-website\" rel=\" noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ixis: 5 Top Tips to Securing Your Drupal Website\"><strong>Read more about securing a Drupal website</strong></a></p>\n\n<article data-align=\"center\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/medium_800/public/2022-12/top_drupal_bp_november_2022_cover-5.png?itok=XuXfz0bz\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Steps covered in fallen autumn leaves\" loading=\"lazy\" /></article><p><em>If you enjoyed this selection of Drupal articles, make sure to tune in for more content on Drupal, agency business and digital strategy that we regularly post here on our blog.</em></p>\n",

          "value": "<p>I have been working in the \"digital agency industry\" for over a decade and I've seen some agencies grow rapidly by growing their client base. In contrast, others have fallen into oblivion due to poor client relationships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The key question is: <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-successful-digital-agency-partnership\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 6 tips for a successful digital agency partnership\">how do we build successful client/agency relationships?</a> If you want to retain your client, you must understand what they really want from their agency. This helps you win their trust and build a successful relationship which will last for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Trust is the foundation of success</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust is the foundation of success. It's a two-way street and it takes time to build. You earn trust by being honest, reliable, competent and transparent. Trust is not given; it's a choice that you make on a daily basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust between an agency and its clients can be built over time if there's mutual respect and understanding of each other's roles in the relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How do you gain your clients' trust?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Client trust is a cornerstone of any client/agency relationship. If clients don’t trust you, they might not be willing to invest in your services or listen to your advice, which could ultimately lead to a poor return on investment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clients need to know that they can trust you because they don’t want their valuable business information falling into the wrong hands. They need transparency and honesty from the agency so that they feel confident in working together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building trust takes time; it doesn’t have to happen overnight! Trustworthiness is about more than just showing up for work on time every day; it's about demonstrating that you care about the client's needs and goals by being available when needed and providing clear explanations regarding how you plan on helping them achieve their goals—and then delivering results!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>How do you keep the client/agency relationships in tune?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are a few tips to help you keep your client/agency relationships on track:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Be open to feedback. If your client is unhappy with something, listen closely and ask questions. Don't get defensive or make excuses. Instead, look at the issue objectively and use it as an opportunity to improve yourself as well as your service offerings.</li>\r\n\t<li>Be consistent in <a href=\"/blog/most-important-thing-agency-partnership\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: The most important thing in an agency partnership\">communication</a>, follow-through, expectations setting—and everything else! Clients want to know that they can count on you no matter what may come up (or not). Consistency will put them at ease in knowing that their business is being handled the way they expect it should be handled—with care and precision!</li>\r\n\t<li>Be transparent about any changes or updates in policy or procedure that may affect business operations such as billing practices and payment terms; also let them know if there are times when certain services might be unavailable for various reasons (e.g. national holidays and vacations). They'll appreciate knowing what factors could affect their decision making process when planning ahead for future projects together!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Your values must be aligned</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We are all busy—and often, it’s hard to find time for a deep, honest conversation about values. But when the two of you do have that conversation, you will be surprised by how much it helps your relationship. Values are the foundation of any long-term client/agency partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Values help build trust and understanding in your working relationship with your clients because they tell them what you stand for as a company. They also help them understand why they should choose you over other vendors who might be able to do similar work. And most importantly: values are what will make your company unique in their eyes!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Communication is key</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You will want to ensure that your client is always able to reach you. This may mean creating a dedicated email address for them, and making sure all of your communication is happening through it. If this isn't possible, then make sure that you're available via phone or text/chat. It's also worth asking them how they prefer to communicate with you in order to get an idea of what they need from the relationship management process so that you can meet those needs effectively:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>Who is their point of contact? Who needs to be in CC? Who is responsible for resolving escalations?&nbsp;</li>\r\n\t<li>Do they prefer email? Or would they rather have a dedicated phone number?</li>\r\n\t<li>Are there times when they don't want notifications from their project manager? Or do they want daily updates on progress?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Bonus: Client retention is easier than client acquisition</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You may feel like you only want to focus on growing your business by bringing new clients on board—but don't forget about the ones who already love working with you! Your current clients are some of the most important people in the world because they already know how awesome it is when they do business with you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Client acquisition is expensive, time-consuming and risky. You can spend a lot of money on sales and marketing—but it doesn't always work. And what happens if your new client doesn't work out? You've lost your investment in time and/or money. If you're lucky enough to acquire a great client, then congratulations! &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Focus more of your attention on retention than acquisition because it's less risky and much more rewarding both professionally and emotionally (not to mention financially).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In conclusion, it’s important to remember that <a href=\"https://www.agiledrop.com/blog/how-can-agencies-grow-their-digital-business\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How can agencies grow their digital business\">the client is your partner</a>.

          "processed": "<p>I have been working in the \"digital agency industry\" for over a decade and I've seen some agencies grow rapidly by growing their client base. In contrast, others have fallen into oblivion due to poor client relationships.</p>\n\n<p>The key question is: <a href=\"/blog/6-tips-successful-digital-agency-partnership\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 6 tips for a successful digital agency partnership\">how do we build successful client/agency relationships?</a> If you want to retain your client, you must understand what they really want from their agency. This helps you win their trust and build a successful relationship which will last for years.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Trust is the foundation of success</h2>\n\n<p>Trust is the foundation of success. It's a two-way street and it takes time to build. You earn trust by being honest, reliable, competent and transparent. Trust is not given; it's a choice that you make on a daily basis.</p>\n\n<p>Trust between an agency and its clients can be built over time if there's mutual respect and understanding of each other's roles in the relationship.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>How do you gain your clients' trust?</h2>\n\n<p>Client trust is a cornerstone of any client/agency relationship. If clients don’t trust you, they might not be willing to invest in your services or listen to your advice, which could ultimately lead to a poor return on investment.</p>\n\n<p>Clients need to know that they can trust you because they don’t want their valuable business information falling into the wrong hands. They need transparency and honesty from the agency so that they feel confident in working together.</p>\n\n<p>Building trust takes time; it doesn’t have to happen overnight! Trustworthiness is about more than just showing up for work on time every day; it's about demonstrating that you care about the client's needs and goals by being available when needed and providing clear explanations regarding how you plan on helping them achieve their goals—and then delivering results!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>How do you keep the client/agency relationships in tune?</h2>\n\n<p>Here are a few tips to help you keep your client/agency relationships on track:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Be open to feedback. If your client is unhappy with something, listen closely and ask questions. Don't get defensive or make excuses. Instead, look at the issue objectively and use it as an opportunity to improve yourself as well as your service offerings.</li>\n\t<li>Be consistent in <a href=\"/blog/most-important-thing-agency-partnership\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: The most important thing in an agency partnership\">communication</a>, follow-through, expectations setting—and everything else! Clients want to know that they can count on you no matter what may come up (or not). Consistency will put them at ease in knowing that their business is being handled the way they expect it should be handled—with care and precision!</li>\n\t<li>Be transparent about any changes or updates in policy or procedure that may affect business operations such as billing practices and payment terms; also let them know if there are times when certain services might be unavailable for various reasons (e.g. national holidays and vacations). They'll appreciate knowing what factors could affect their decision making process when planning ahead for future projects together!</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n\n<h2>Your values must be aligned</h2>\n\n<p>We are all busy—and often, it’s hard to find time for a deep, honest conversation about values. But when the two of you do have that conversation, you will be surprised by how much it helps your relationship. Values are the foundation of any long-term client/agency partnership.</p>\n\n<p>Values help build trust and understanding in your working relationship with your clients because they tell them what you stand for as a company. They also help them understand why they should choose you over other vendors who might be able to do similar work. And most importantly: values are what will make your company unique in their eyes!</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Communication is key</h2>\n\n<p>You will want to ensure that your client is always able to reach you. This may mean creating a dedicated email address for them, and making sure all of your communication is happening through it. If this isn't possible, then make sure that you're available via phone or text/chat. It's also worth asking them how they prefer to communicate with you in order to get an idea of what they need from the relationship management process so that you can meet those needs effectively:</p>\n\n<ul><li>Who is their point of contact? Who needs to be in CC? Who is responsible for resolving escalations? </li>\n\t<li>Do they prefer email? Or would they rather have a dedicated phone number?</li>\n\t<li>Are there times when they don't want notifications from their project manager? Or do they want daily updates on progress?</li>\n</ul><p> </p>\n\n<h2>Bonus: Client retention is easier than client acquisition</h2>\n\n<p>You may feel like you only want to focus on growing your business by bringing new clients on board—but don't forget about the ones who already love working with you! Your current clients are some of the most important people in the world because they already know how awesome it is when they do business with you.</p>\n\n<p>Client acquisition is expensive, time-consuming and risky. You can spend a lot of money on sales and marketing—but it doesn't always work. And what happens if your new client doesn't work out? You've lost your investment in time and/or money. If you're lucky enough to acquire a great client, then congratulations!  </p>\n\n<p>Focus more of your attention on retention than acquisition because it's less risky and much more rewarding both professionally and emotionally (not to mention financially).</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>In conclusion, it’s important to remember that <a href=\"https://www.agiledrop.com/blog/how-can-agencies-grow-their-digital-business\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How can agencies grow their digital business\">the client is your partner</a>. You want them to feel like they are in good hands and that you will do what it takes to stay on top of things. The relationship between a client and an agency can be a long one if both parties are willing to put in the effort.</p>\n\n<article data-align=\"center\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/medium_800/public/2022-11/relationship_management_between_agencies_and_clients_cover-3.png?itok=lEmF-_b5\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Short orange tracks with one person contrasted by a longer green track with two people shaking hands\" loading=\"lazy\" /></article><p><em>Looking for a long-term development partner?

          "value": "<p>The recent massive shift to the digital has required businesses and organizations in every sector to streamline the digital experiences they provide to their users and customers. In fact, a lot of companies didn’t even have a (performant) website to begin with, so they had to start out just by creating an adequate website experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"/podcast/anne-stefanyk-digital-transformation-nonprofits\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Anne Stefanyk - Digital transformation for nonprofits\">Nonprofits and NGOs</a> were one of the most heavily impacted sectors, as they were faced with the challenge to keep their donors and the rest of their communities engaged in this new digital reality. The catch is that nonprofit organizations typically don’t possess very strong in-house tech capabilities, which this new reality now suddenly requires them to have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is where outsourcing comes into play. While in some cases it might make sense to leverage the help of freelancers, the best way to go about it is to partner with a highly capable development agency for a full-on digital transformation or <a href=\"/podcast/corey-vilhauer-deane-barker-web-project-guide\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Corey Vilhauer &amp; Deane Barker - The Web Project Guide\">website project</a>. In this article, we’ll break down the most important reasons for such a partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Talent shortage</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The economic uncertainty that we’re experiencing as a result of all the societal pressures is also causing massive disturbances to the job market, what has been called “<a href=\"/podcast/raj-sundarason-great-resignation-what-are-best-ways-forward\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Raj Sundarason - The Great Resignation: What are the best ways forward?\">the great resignation</a>”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main consequences is that it’s much harder now to <a href=\"/blog/how-attract-retain-top-tech-talent-2022\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How to attract &amp; retain top tech talent in 2022\">find and retain top talent</a> in house, especially in the tech field. It’s even harder to build a full team if (or rather, when!) you need one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A specialized development agency can supply a full team of developers, for exactly as long as you need it; what’s more, they’re able to easily supply substitutes in case something unexpected happens with one of the original team members (as opposed to partnering with a freelancer). This makes such an agency partnership very cost and time efficient.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Knowledge of open&nbsp;source</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major benefit of partnering with a development agency is that they tend to be experts in open-source software, which is both more budget-friendly and more in line with the nonprofit mindset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain open-source technologies are particularly streamlined for nonprofit organizations; <strong>many nonprofits opt for <a href=\"/blog/when-drupal-best-choice-you\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: When is Drupal the best choice for you?\">Drupal</a></strong>, for example, which is both highly capable and easily configured to be optimally used by non-developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The remote &amp; digital way of life</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Digitalization and the adoption of remote lifestyles are especially impactful for the nonprofit sector.

          "processed": "<p>The recent massive shift to the digital has required businesses and organizations in every sector to streamline the digital experiences they provide to their users and customers. In fact, a lot of companies didn’t even have a (performant) website to begin with, so they had to start out just by creating an adequate website experience.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/podcast/anne-stefanyk-digital-transformation-nonprofits\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Anne Stefanyk - Digital transformation for nonprofits\">Nonprofits and NGOs</a> were one of the most heavily impacted sectors, as they were faced with the challenge to keep their donors and the rest of their communities engaged in this new digital reality. The catch is that nonprofit organizations typically don’t possess very strong in-house tech capabilities, which this new reality now suddenly requires them to have.</p>\n\n<p>This is where outsourcing comes into play. While in some cases it might make sense to leverage the help of freelancers, the best way to go about it is to partner with a highly capable development agency for a full-on digital transformation or <a href=\"/podcast/corey-vilhauer-deane-barker-web-project-guide\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Corey Vilhauer &amp; Deane Barker - The Web Project Guide\">website project</a>. In this article, we’ll break down the most important reasons for such a partnership.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Talent shortage</h2>\n\n<p>The economic uncertainty that we’re experiencing as a result of all the societal pressures is also causing massive disturbances to the job market, what has been called “<a href=\"/podcast/raj-sundarason-great-resignation-what-are-best-ways-forward\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Raj Sundarason - The Great Resignation: What are the best ways forward?\">the great resignation</a>”.</p>\n\n<p>One of the main consequences is that it’s much harder now to <a href=\"/blog/how-attract-retain-top-tech-talent-2022\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How to attract &amp; retain top tech talent in 2022\">find and retain top talent</a> in house, especially in the tech field. It’s even harder to build a full team if (or rather, when!) you need one.</p>\n\n<p>A specialized development agency can supply a full team of developers, for exactly as long as you need it; what’s more, they’re able to easily supply substitutes in case something unexpected happens with one of the original team members (as opposed to partnering with a freelancer). This makes such an agency partnership very cost and time efficient.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Knowledge of open&nbsp;source</h2>\n\n<p>Another major benefit of partnering with a development agency is that they tend to be experts in open-source software, which is both more budget-friendly and more in line with the nonprofit mindset.</p>\n\n<p>Certain open-source technologies are particularly streamlined for nonprofit organizations; <strong>many nonprofits opt for <a href=\"/blog/when-drupal-best-choice-you\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: When is Drupal the best choice for you?\">Drupal</a></strong>, for example, which is both highly capable and easily configured to be optimally used by non-developers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>The remote &amp; digital way of life</h2>\n\n<p>Digitalization and the adoption of remote lifestyles are especially impactful for the nonprofit sector. The vast majority of services are now accessed digitally, and the shift to remote work has led to <a href=\"/blog/why-outsourcing-way-go-times-uncertainty\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Why outsourcing is the way to go for times of uncertainty\">much less (or rather, no) aversion to working with remote agency partners</a>.</p>\n\n<p>For nonprofits, one of the most impactful consequences of this digitalization is the newfound <strong>convenience of online payments</strong>.

However, Drupal 10 also tries to reach outside Drupal and appeal to developers from other communities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest upgrades here is streamlined JavaScript support, with modern JavaScript replacing certain uses of jQuery, in addition to the Decoupled Menus initiative which has committed to facilitating working with different JavaScript-based front-end frameworks and libraries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another interesting feature for the front end is the Starterkit theme generator.

Content managers &amp; editors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The second core user group are content managers and editors. These benefit predominantly from the update from CKEditor 4 to the streamlined version 5 and the inclusion of Claro as the default administration theme in Drupal core.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketers need easy to use editing capabilities which enable them to create customized content which is easily accessible by anybody. Both of the updates mentioned above take this into consideration, as does the new core front-end theme Olivero, which continues to prioritize accessibility while also providing support for more modern and currently desirable website features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Ambitious site builders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The last, but certainly not least important user group are (ambitious) site builders, who have become Drupal’s main new target group as we mentioned in the introductory section.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They have become accustomed to working with <a href=\"/blog/drupal-no-code-low-code-tool\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Drupal as a no-code / low-code tool\">no-code / low-code</a> tools, and many of the current strategic initiatives are focusing on improving this kind of site building experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The already mentioned Decoupled Menus initiative is definitely important here, as it facilitates the creation of more advanced digital experiences. There are also the Project Browser and Easy out of the box initiatives, both of which are focused on empowering beginners and less technically savvy users to create great experiences faster and more easily.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The Open Web is for everyone</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>But the main change of Drupal 10 is the change in philosophy – or, rather, an adjustment of Drupal’s existing philosophy to the trends and shifts in the spheres of web content and digital experience management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The philosophy of the open web is that the web should be for everyone, which automatically makes Drupal a steward of the open web. As we’ve just highlighted, much of the current focus is on improving the experience of beginners and newcomers, both from other open-source communities as well as those with (little to) no technical knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a recent <a href=\"/blog/behind-scenes-look-mercury-editor-justin-toupin-aten-design\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Behind the scenes look into the Mercury Editor with Justin Toupin of Aten Design\">interview we did with Justin Toupin of Aten Design</a>, we talked about how Drupal has until now been very heavily focused on the developer persona, and how hopefully current and future initiatives in the context of no code and low code will empower other key personas as well.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Drupal 10 represents a crucial step from a framework which is majorly developer-oriented to a much more user-friendly platform for the other main user types that are gaining in popularity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Celebrating Drupal 10</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As long-time supporters of Drupal who have been heavily involved in the <a href=\"/blog/category/community\" title=\"Agiledrop blog - Community\">community</a>, Agiledrop will celebrate this release by hosting and sponsoring a <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/community/events/drupal-10-release-party-drupal-slovenia-meetup-2022-12-14\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Drupal 10 release party &amp; Drupal Slovenia Meetup\">Drupal 10 release party</a> in our Ljubljana headquarters on December 14.

The focus of the interview is headless architecture and how Drupal is positioned as a headless CMS, following the announcement of the Acquia CMS Headless Starter Kit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the core points of discussion is the comparison of how Drupal and WordPress approach headless, with Drupal having headless capabilities as part of the core platform rather than being bolted on. In the final part of the interview, Dries and Richard take a look at how Drupal compares to pure headless providers and how it fits into the jamstack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/how-drupal-fits-into-an-increasingly-headless-cms-world/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"The New Stack: How Drupal Fits Into an Increasingly Headless CMS World\"><strong>Read more about Drupal’s position as a headless CMS</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal Headless vs. Drupal Monolithic - Bringing The Traditional CMS Into The Future</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s continue with another post about headless Drupal, this one coming from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/perandre\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Per Andre Rønsen Twitter\">Per Andre Rønsen</a> of <a href=\"https://frontkom.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Frontkom homepage\">Frontkom</a> who compares traditional / monolithic Drupal against headless Drupal. He starts off with a brief overview of traditional Drupal and its history, before moving on to the rise of headless content management systems and how Drupal functions as one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second part of the article, Per breaks down the benefits and use cases of using Drupal as a decoupled CMS; these include improved digital UX, better reach in the omnichannel landscape, increased security, and painless content management across mobile apps as well as for custom intranets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.frontkom.com/en/drupal-headless-vs.-drupal-monolithic-bringing-the-traditional-cms-into-the-future\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Frontkom: Drupal Headless vs. Drupal Monolithic - Bringing The Traditional CMS Into The Future\"><strong>Read more about headless vs. monolithic Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal 9: Creating Ajax Dialogs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have an article from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipnorton42\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Philip Norton Twitter\">Philip Norton</a> on the <a href=\"https://www.hashbangcode.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#!

It first introduces the different dialog types – normal, modal and off-canvas dialogs, and then proceeds with the steps for creating each of the types through the respective PHP class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second half of the article is dedicated to the three different ways of adding an Ajax dialog through attributes: by using a render array; by adding attributes to link definitions; or by editing HTML which can even be done by content creators and editors with minimum coding knowledge.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hashbangcode.com/article/drupal-9-creating-ajax-dialogs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#!

Single Directory Components in Core!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>For the past several months, at least one article from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeherchel\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mike Herchel Twitter\">Mike Herchel</a> has been regularly featured in our monthly recap, and this month is no exception. He delivers another great article teasing an upcoming Drupal core feature that they’ve begun working on together with Mateu Aguiló Bosch, Lauri Eskola, Wim Leers and Hawkeye Tenderwolf.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The feature is one that many modern development frameworks already employ – single directory components, which greatly improve the developer experience by allowing developers to more easily work with components and share them across projects. Mike hopes to have this introduced into Drupal Core with version 10.1, planned for June 2023.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://herchel.com/articles/single-directory-components-core\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Herchel: Single Directory Components in Core!

It starts off with some basics of content management systems and Drupal in particular, delving a little into its origins and its usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most salient part of the article is dedicated to what Drupal’s appeal is for the business roles that most frequently work with it. For example, developers enjoy its open-source nature and advanced tooling; marketers benefit from greater autonomy, accessibility, SEO support, etc; while CMOs and CIOs expect scalability, good performance and a fast time to market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/blog/what-is-drupal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Acquia: An Introduction to Drupal CMS\"><strong>Read more about the Drupal CMS</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Two months until Drupal 10 is expected to be released!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We finish with another entry from the Drupal Association, this one announcing and confirming the expected release date of Drupal 10 as December 14th – in just over two months.

What is the Mercury Editor and what were the main reasons behind the decision to create it?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://atendesigngroup.com/mercury-editor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Aten Design: Mercury Editor\">Mercury Editor</a> is a tool built in Drupal, on top of Drupal, for really easy-to-use, low-code or even no-code, drag and drop editing. It's built on Paragraphs, so it's built on systems that a lot of Drupal developers are already familiar with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And something that I feel is really important, is that it still embraces this idea of structured content. So it's still following the same model that exists in Drupal of entities and fieldable entities. It's not doing something else to manage the content, it's still adhering to structured content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What led us to start investing in developing it was, in my view, the lack of a good authoring experience using structured content. And if not the lack of a good authoring experience, maybe a better way to put it is just the fact that what we're offering authors right now in Drupal is really complicated, really hard to use. It just doesn't stand up to other tools like WordPress or SquareSpace, where literally everyone has a story.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Drupal, we have a lot of flexibility and a lot of capability from a technology perspective, but often at the expense of the authoring experience. And so that dynamic is something that we've been concerned about for a really long time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I think now several years ago, right at the beginning of Drupal 8, and actually in Drupal 7 as well, we started looking at ways to improve that and try to build a more flexible component-driven approach to editing and managing content.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast forward several years, we started thinking that Paragraphs could be the basis for this. Combining layout with paragraphs and developing this really flexible, easy-to-use approach then led to Layout Paragraphs, which is a module available on drupal.org that combines the layout API and enables easy management of layouts with paragraphs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then on top of that, we have further built this authoring experience that we're calling Mercury Editor. To clarify a little bit about what that is: for us, Mercury Editor is still open source. It's a collection of Drupal modules, plus customization, targeting specifically the needs of each client's project, each client site.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>2. Is there a story behind the name “Mercury Editor” – why “mercury”?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The big thing is, mercury the metal, it being super fluid, just kind of works well with the idea of a fluid editing system. We even played with the word ‘fluid’ directly. We ended up moving away from that for a few reasons.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the idea is, this very flexible metal seemed to play into some of the themes of the editor. Over the years, our own agency brand has developed into a lot of space themes, exploration, kind of future-forward explorations. We find some of the humanistic themes and space exploration to be pretty interesting. So Mercury the planet kind of works for that too.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that word seemed to work well for us to convey some of the properties of the editor itself. And the logo itself reflects it as well, featuring this kind of shapeless, yet shapeful iconography.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>3. Is there a specific market which you think that the Mercury Editor is best suited for?&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>That's a great question. The ideal customer, the ideal user for Mercury is marketing and editorial staff. A couple of years ago, I was doing a demo with a large public university in the States, right in our area. There were half a dozen people on the call, all but one of them Drupal developers. And then there was one marketer.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we went around the room at the beginning and everyone was saying what they do and why they're there. And of course, each Drupal developer was like, well, I’m a Drupal developer, I'm really interested in what the thing would do for our Drupal ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And we got to the marketing person and they said, oh, I'm in marketing, I'm all about content. This stuff is all going to go over my head. I'm just here to listen. This is not for me, I'm just here to listen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And of course I'm thinking, this actually is for you. And we did a demo and after the demo, the conversation completely changed and that person was asking all the questions, super excited about what this meant for them, their department, their ability to own the authoring experience – or rather, their ability to own the content, their ability to have autonomy about creating content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly it's like, oh, I don't have to call a developer every time I want to do something a little bit different. I have a lot of flexibility with how I publish content, which, given the year we're in, is where publishing tools should be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And I think that too often we think about the developer experience, the total final capabilities of the system, and don't give enough consideration to people who want to tell a story. That's what a content management system is here to do – empowering those personas, those people, to do that kind of work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, marketers and editorial staff in universities and university settings – a lot of universities are moving to distributions with Drupal, where they use a single distribution and then spin that up for different internal customers in the university.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercury or at least Layout Paragraphs is the perfect solution for that; it gives a lot of autonomy, a lot of flexibility to each internal customer in that sense. I think publishing sites, clearly, can make use of this kind of thing, as well as cultural heritage institutions like museums – anyone who needs to tell a flexible story.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it's still easy to create components and to create a library of components and have some governance and limitations around what can be created. So it's both giving autonomy to people who care about content while also doing it in a structured, predictable way.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>4. Did you face any challenges in creating the editor, first in the discovery phase when you were finding the “how”, and also later in the implementation phase when you started putting everything together?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course. Early on we were pushing Paragraphs pretty hard with clients. And there were a few clients, one in particular comes to mind, who pushed back quite hard. As developers, <em>we</em> could see the capability and flexibility of everything Paragraphs could provide for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for the people on their team who care about content, it was just too complicated, to the point where eventually the client was like, stop talking to me about paragraphs, it's too complicated. This solution isn't going to work for us.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And honestly, that got me thinking, it's true, this thing that we've been pushing, it works, the capability is there, but it's not a good authoring experience. So that was one of those early challenges that pushed us to go further and to try to build more sophisticated tools on top of Paragraphs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The deal with Paragraphs is that it already provides this really solid approach to structured content – fields, fieldable entities, all these structures already exist in Drupal, and all that functionality comes along with that.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That was one thing early on. Also, just as an agency, we exist to serve clients. The needs of our clients are all very different. As much as we try to reduce the amount of custom work to the greatest extent we can, just for efficiency's sake, the needs of each project are still unique and different, and we're always pulled in different directions.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, anytime an agency ends up trying to develop a product, there are challenges inherent to that. We have to go where the client work is. It's not always in line with where we're trying to take this thing. That said, since we are so focused on people who care about content and our clients care about content, it's worked for us and against us in some cases.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>5. You're very likely aware that there are alternatives that already exist in similar ways, no-code, low-code solutions. Did you learn about those too, or did you just say, let’s leave it, let’s not fill our heads with what someone else did, and just start from scratch?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>That's a great question. I would say yes, we have explored what else is out there, of course, especially in the Drupal universe. And there are a lot of other great tools out there. Gutenberg, which started as a WordPress plugin, has been in Drupal for a while. It’s a really great system for this block-based, what-you-see-is-what-you-get editing experience.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The challenge for us is, Gutenberg or CKEditor 5 or any of these open-text WYSIWYG editors end up stepping outside of some of the very strong structured content principles in Drupal. So you lose fieldable entities, you lose all of the APIs that are built on some of those low-level systems, and you end up having to build something else for governance, for permissions, for migration, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you build, say, a testimonial widget in CKEditor 5, and it's just going to save the content in line with this template that you created as markup in the database, if the format of that changes later, you have to somehow account for that in future migrations and develop some kind of consistency. It's not just built in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whereas if you're working within fields and fieldable entities, it's not perfect, but a lot of that's taken care of for you. So it's much easier to get those mappings right in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that's what we were most interested in – leveraging some of those concepts of structured content that exist in Drupal and that are already so well executed in Drupal rather than doing something else.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>6. Why is drag and drop such an important feature in modern digital experiences, besides the obvious marketer need that we’ve already talked about?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I like that question a lot too, because in reality, I'm not sure that it is that important, And what I mean is, I don't think it's drag and drop exactly that's important, but I think it's what drag and drop represents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's really like the low-code, no-code piece. It's the idea that there should be tools for an editor to seamlessly, easily, in a very expressive way create the content that they want to create and be focused on the story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was just talking with somebody yesterday about this who found that their editors don't actually like drag and drop. They want to be able to move things around with the keyboard. Or they want more interactive tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone understands drag and drop. So when you say, hey, it's drag and drop, they at least understand what you're saying, that it's not writing code and it's flexible and they can use a mouse and a keyboard to make it happen.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in reality, the piece that I think is so important has less to do with the specific interaction of dragging and dropping and more to do with creating an experience that allows content writers, people who care about content, to create exactly the kind of content they're interested in in a very easy way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So that's what drag and drop represents. To me, it's more a low or no code authoring requirement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>7. Do you have any interesting case studies to showcase the Mercury Editor?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercury has been a part of a lot of client projects at this point and it's in a lot of client projects that are ongoing, such as the Florida State University Libraries, the Guttmacher Institute and Tufts Now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing I've been working on recently that's been really interesting is a decoupled implementation of Mercury, for Quadient. Seeing Layout Paragraphs in Mercury work in a decoupled environment has been really cool. And using this Drupal construct to drive a VueJS experience has been really interesting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And it's also given us a chance to start creating some best practices for how we interpret layout in that front-end system. It's been interesting to validate one of the reasons that we went down this path and that we wanted to use existing constructs in Drupal, things like JSON:API, which is, of course, pushing out the entity content – it just works.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We just get all the layout information in JSON:API. We can easily interpret that in the front end and do whatever we want to with it. So that's been really cool. We're talking to some universities about using this in their distros, which is also really exciting. And hopefully by next DrupalCon we'll have more specific cases to show off.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>8. Besides the obvious content authoring benefits for clients, what are the other benefits for users, also in financial terms – does this mean that they get more for less?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Absolutely. First off, it means reducing ongoing development costs. An organization can define the components that are appropriate for their content ahead of time, at the time of build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They can define their library of components. They can set up the governance rules around what can be published in what way, and then turn that over to their authors, to their writers. And they don't have to keep going back to the development team to keep adjusting to the needs of content moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, often, when editorial teams or marketing teams want to create something that looks a little bit different than the last thing they created, they're calling developers. And that can really drive cost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And this means cost in two ways. One is just the financial cost of having to involve an agency or your development resources, which are often in high demand. But the other cost is in time, having to wait to get on some schedule, to get on a specific team’s agile backlog, and wait until the priority is just right to have your piece of content created. There's an expense there in terms of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mercury saves money in terms of reducing development costs. Actually, even the upfront cost for Mercury is not terribly significant when compared to all the other custom approaches in Drupal. So, it reduces the ongoing development cost and it reduces time to market, because marketers can move and create exactly the kind of content they want really quickly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>9. How do you see the future of <a href=\"/blog/drupal-no-code-low-code-tool\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Drupal as a no-code / low-code tool\">Drupal in the context of low-code / no-code</a>?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The future of Drupal is a big question. I don't even know where to start. The developments in Drupal 8 and beyond are really exciting. Composer-based architecture, pulling in third-party libraries, just generally making it easier for developers to collaborate. There's been a lot of focus on the developer experience, and that's awesome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm hoping that we also start to see more and more focus on the authoring experience. And I think we're seeing some of that; we see it with Claro now being the default admin theme, and it's such a huge improvement from what we had before, seeing the work that's happening with the Gin admin theme on top of Claro.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And as you said, there are lots of tools, there are lots of people investing in this authoring space. Again, I think the developer persona has been first and foremost in Drupal for years, since the beginning. And I think we're starting to see more and more attention paid to the marketer and editorial staff, the writer, the journalist, the storyteller persona.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hopefully that continues to be a direction that Drupal focuses on. That's certainly the direction that my agency is focused on and where we want to take our work with Drupal.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then I think as far as how low code or no code plays into that, when we're not talking about a developer persona, no- and low code is very important, as we're talking about people who have very pressing, important work to do – and it's not coding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And for us Drupal people, that's often hard to get our heads around – like, what do you mean, pressing work is not coding? But for people who care about content and have important stories to tell, the work is the content. And the mission often is the content. And so in order to get that right, we have to be thinking in terms of low and no code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>10. I remember the Driesnote from Portland and one thing that really resonated with me back then is that Drupal should be for ambitious site builders. A couple of years ago, we talked about ambitious digital experiences, which involved predominantly back-end work. And now that’s shifted to ambitious site builders.&nbsp;</h3>\r\n\r\n<h3>This could be understood as moving more into low code – not yet no code, though, since site builders typically still need to do some basic coding. But this is something that also needs to be taken into account, how Dries and the Drupal Association see Drupal evolving.</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>I agree with that. That idea worries me a little bit also because I think sometimes it's almost like we try to make the wrong things easy in Drupal. Creating a front end for Composer, for example, where developers, the people who are often using Composer to manage dependencies, are very comfortable using it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's the same with Git. Who uses a UI for Git? I mean, there are some good ones out there that people use a little, but just about everyone uses the command line for Git. There’s no need for more than that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I’m more concerned with clients and organizations, especially in larger organization settings, e.g. a university where you have a core web services team who is managing the web presence for hundreds, sometimes thousands of websites across the university and trying to serve those internal customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where I want to see things go is where the people who own those sites, who are writing content for those sites or actually have to maintain them, are excited about the capabilities of this thing that they have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Often that's not quite the case. Often it's the site builder providing those services who's excited about that. And maybe that's just it. Maybe “Drupal's for ambitious site builders” is like a starting point, or it's along the way on that journey toward embracing those non-developer personas.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because at the end, it's all about content. It's all about publishing content. And the people who are actually publishing content, who have the important things to say, need to be empowered to actually do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>11. I almost feel like we’re going in this direction that maybe we as a Drupal community or people from Drupal agencies don't listen to marketing people enough. Or am I wrong here?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>No, I don't think you're wrong. I think that's true. We still tend to live in this very developer-centric, developer-led world – let's call it the IT world.

At the recent <a href=\"/blog/drupalcon-prague-2022-first-person-european-drupalcon-after-3-years\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: DrupalCon Prague 2022 – the first in-person European DrupalCon after 3 years\">DrupalCon Prague</a>, I had a great conversation about the Mercury Editor developed by <a href=\"https://atendesigngroup.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Aten Design homepage\">Aten Design Group</a> with their CEO <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/justin2pin\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Justin Toupin drupal.org\">Justin Toupin</a>.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/blog/interview-justin-toupin-ceo-aten-design-group-enhancing-drupals-authoring-experience\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with Justin Toupin, CEO of Aten Design Group: Enhancing Drupal's authoring experience\">We’ve recently already featured Justin in an interview</a> and he already spoke about the Mercury Editor then, but the opportunity to learn more about it from Justin in person was too great to pass up, and I’m excited to be able to share our insightful conversation with our readers.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>1. What is the Mercury Editor and what were the main reasons behind the decision to create it?&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://atendesigngroup.com/mercury-editor\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Aten Design: Mercury Editor\">Mercury Editor</a> is a tool built in Drupal, on top of Drupal, for really easy-to-use, low-code or even no-code, drag and drop editing. It's built on Paragraphs, so it's built on systems that a lot of Drupal developers are already familiar with.</p>\n\n<p>And something that I feel is really important, is that it still embraces this idea of structured content. So it's still following the same model that exists in Drupal of entities and fieldable entities. It's not doing something else to manage the content, it's still adhering to structured content.</p>\n\n<p>What led us to start investing in developing it was, in my view, the lack of a good authoring experience using structured content. And if not the lack of a good authoring experience, maybe a better way to put it is just the fact that what we're offering authors right now in Drupal is really complicated, really hard to use. It just doesn't stand up to other tools like WordPress or SquareSpace, where literally everyone has a story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With Drupal, we have a lot of flexibility and a lot of capability from a technology perspective, but often at the expense of the authoring experience. And so that dynamic is something that we've been concerned about for a really long time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And I think now several years ago, right at the beginning of Drupal 8, and actually in Drupal 7 as well, we started looking at ways to improve that and try to build a more flexible component-driven approach to editing and managing content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Fast forward several years, we started thinking that Paragraphs could be the basis for this. Combining layout with paragraphs and developing this really flexible, easy-to-use approach then led to Layout Paragraphs, which is a module available on drupal.org that combines the layout API and enables easy management of layouts with paragraphs.</p>\n\n<p>And then on top of that, we have further built this authoring experience that we're calling Mercury Editor. To clarify a little bit about what that is: for us, Mercury Editor is still open source. It's a collection of Drupal modules, plus customization, targeting specifically the needs of each client's project, each client site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>2. Is there a story behind the name “Mercury Editor” – why “mercury”?</h3>\n\n<p>The big thing is, mercury the metal, it being super fluid, just kind of works well with the idea of a fluid editing system. We even played with the word ‘fluid’ directly. We ended up moving away from that for a few reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But the idea is, this very flexible metal seemed to play into some of the themes of the editor. Over the years, our own agency brand has developed into a lot of space themes, exploration, kind of future-forward explorations. We find some of the humanistic themes and space exploration to be pretty interesting. So Mercury the planet kind of works for that too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So that word seemed to work well for us to convey some of the properties of the editor itself. And the logo itself reflects it as well, featuring this kind of shapeless, yet shapeful iconography.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>3. Is there a specific market which you think that the Mercury Editor is best suited for?&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<p>That's a great question. The ideal customer, the ideal user for Mercury is marketing and editorial staff. A couple of years ago, I was doing a demo with a large public university in the States, right in our area. There were half a dozen people on the call, all but one of them Drupal developers. And then there was one marketer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And we went around the room at the beginning and everyone was saying what they do and why they're there. And of course, each Drupal developer was like, well, I’m a Drupal developer, I'm really interested in what the thing would do for our Drupal ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And we got to the marketing person and they said, oh, I'm in marketing, I'm all about content. This stuff is all going to go over my head. I'm just here to listen. This is not for me, I'm just here to listen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And of course I'm thinking, this actually is for you. And we did a demo and after the demo, the conversation completely changed and that person was asking all the questions, super excited about what this meant for them, their department, their ability to own the authoring experience – or rather, their ability to own the content, their ability to have autonomy about creating content.</p>\n\n<p>Suddenly it's like, oh, I don't have to call a developer every time I want to do something a little bit different. I have a lot of flexibility with how I publish content, which, given the year we're in, is where publishing tools should be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And I think that too often we think about the developer experience, the total final capabilities of the system, and don't give enough consideration to people who want to tell a story. That's what a content management system is here to do – empowering those personas, those people, to do that kind of work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, marketers and editorial staff in universities and university settings – a lot of universities are moving to distributions with Drupal, where they use a single distribution and then spin that up for different internal customers in the university.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Mercury or at least Layout Paragraphs is the perfect solution for that; it gives a lot of autonomy, a lot of flexibility to each internal customer in that sense. I think publishing sites, clearly, can make use of this kind of thing, as well as cultural heritage institutions like museums – anyone who needs to tell a flexible story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And it's still easy to create components and to create a library of components and have some governance and limitations around what can be created. So it's both giving autonomy to people who care about content while also doing it in a structured, predictable way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>4. Did you face any challenges in creating the editor, first in the discovery phase when you were finding the “how”, and also later in the implementation phase when you started putting everything together?</h3>\n\n<p>Of course. Early on we were pushing Paragraphs pretty hard with clients. And there were a few clients, one in particular comes to mind, who pushed back quite hard. As developers, <em>we</em> could see the capability and flexibility of everything Paragraphs could provide for them.</p>\n\n<p>But for the people on their team who care about content, it was just too complicated, to the point where eventually the client was like, stop talking to me about paragraphs, it's too complicated. This solution isn't going to work for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And honestly, that got me thinking, it's true, this thing that we've been pushing, it works, the capability is there, but it's not a good authoring experience. So that was one of those early challenges that pushed us to go further and to try to build more sophisticated tools on top of Paragraphs.</p>\n\n<p>The deal with Paragraphs is that it already provides this really solid approach to structured content – fields, fieldable entities, all these structures already exist in Drupal, and all that functionality comes along with that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>That was one thing early on. Also, just as an agency, we exist to serve clients. The needs of our clients are all very different. As much as we try to reduce the amount of custom work to the greatest extent we can, just for efficiency's sake, the needs of each project are still unique and different, and we're always pulled in different directions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So, anytime an agency ends up trying to develop a product, there are challenges inherent to that. We have to go where the client work is. It's not always in line with where we're trying to take this thing. That said, since we are so focused on people who care about content and our clients care about content, it's worked for us and against us in some cases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>5. You're very likely aware that there are alternatives that already exist in similar ways, no-code, low-code solutions. Did you learn about those too, or did you just say, let’s leave it, let’s not fill our heads with what someone else did, and just start from scratch?</h3>\n\n<p>That's a great question. I would say yes, we have explored what else is out there, of course, especially in the Drupal universe. And there are a lot of other great tools out there. Gutenberg, which started as a WordPress plugin, has been in Drupal for a while. It’s a really great system for this block-based, what-you-see-is-what-you-get editing experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The challenge for us is, Gutenberg or CKEditor 5 or any of these open-text WYSIWYG editors end up stepping outside of some of the very strong structured content principles in Drupal. So you lose fieldable entities, you lose all of the APIs that are built on some of those low-level systems, and you end up having to build something else for governance, for permissions, for migration, etc.</p>\n\n<p>If you build, say, a testimonial widget in CKEditor 5, and it's just going to save the content in line with this template that you created as markup in the database, if the format of that changes later, you have to somehow account for that in future migrations and develop some kind of consistency. It's not just built in.</p>\n\n<p>Whereas if you're working within fields and fieldable entities, it's not perfect, but a lot of that's taken care of for you. So it's much easier to get those mappings right in the future.</p>\n\n<p>And that's what we were most interested in – leveraging some of those concepts of structured content that exist in Drupal and that are already so well executed in Drupal rather than doing something else.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>6. Why is drag and drop such an important feature in modern digital experiences, besides the obvious marketer need that we’ve already talked about?</h3>\n\n<p>I like that question a lot too, because in reality, I'm not sure that it is that important, And what I mean is, I don't think it's drag and drop exactly that's important, but I think it's what drag and drop represents.</p>\n\n<p>It's really like the low-code, no-code piece. It's the idea that there should be tools for an editor to seamlessly, easily, in a very expressive way create the content that they want to create and be focused on the story.</p>\n\n<p>I was just talking with somebody yesterday about this who found that their editors don't actually like drag and drop. They want to be able to move things around with the keyboard. Or they want more interactive tools.</p>\n\n<p>Everyone understands drag and drop. So when you say, hey, it's drag and drop, they at least understand what you're saying, that it's not writing code and it's flexible and they can use a mouse and a keyboard to make it happen.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>But in reality, the piece that I think is so important has less to do with the specific interaction of dragging and dropping and more to do with creating an experience that allows content writers, people who care about content, to create exactly the kind of content they're interested in in a very easy way.</p>\n\n<p>So that's what drag and drop represents. To me, it's more a low or no code authoring requirement.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>7. Do you have any interesting case studies to showcase the Mercury Editor?</h3>\n\n<p>Mercury has been a part of a lot of client projects at this point and it's in a lot of client projects that are ongoing, such as the Florida State University Libraries, the Guttmacher Institute and Tufts Now.</p>\n\n<p>One thing I've been working on recently that's been really interesting is a decoupled implementation of Mercury, for Quadient. Seeing Layout Paragraphs in Mercury work in a decoupled environment has been really cool. And using this Drupal construct to drive a VueJS experience has been really interesting.</p>\n\n<p>And it's also given us a chance to start creating some best practices for how we interpret layout in that front-end system. It's been interesting to validate one of the reasons that we went down this path and that we wanted to use existing constructs in Drupal, things like JSON:API, which is, of course, pushing out the entity content – it just works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>We just get all the layout information in JSON:API. We can easily interpret that in the front end and do whatever we want to with it. So that's been really cool. We're talking to some universities about using this in their distros, which is also really exciting. And hopefully by next DrupalCon we'll have more specific cases to show off.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>8. Besides the obvious content authoring benefits for clients, what are the other benefits for users, also in financial terms – does this mean that they get more for less?</h3>\n\n<p>Absolutely. First off, it means reducing ongoing development costs. An organization can define the components that are appropriate for their content ahead of time, at the time of build.</p>\n\n<p>They can define their library of components. They can set up the governance rules around what can be published in what way, and then turn that over to their authors, to their writers. And they don't have to keep going back to the development team to keep adjusting to the needs of content moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Right now, often, when editorial teams or marketing teams want to create something that looks a little bit different than the last thing they created, they're calling developers. And that can really drive cost.</p>\n\n<p>And this means cost in two ways. One is just the financial cost of having to involve an agency or your development resources, which are often in high demand. But the other cost is in time, having to wait to get on some schedule, to get on a specific team’s agile backlog, and wait until the priority is just right to have your piece of content created. There's an expense there in terms of time.</p>\n\n<p>Mercury saves money in terms of reducing development costs. Actually, even the upfront cost for Mercury is not terribly significant when compared to all the other custom approaches in Drupal. So, it reduces the ongoing development cost and it reduces time to market, because marketers can move and create exactly the kind of content they want really quickly.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>9. How do you see the future of <a href=\"/blog/drupal-no-code-low-code-tool\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Drupal as a no-code / low-code tool\">Drupal in the context of low-code / no-code</a>?</h3>\n\n<p>The future of Drupal is a big question. I don't even know where to start. The developments in Drupal 8 and beyond are really exciting. Composer-based architecture, pulling in third-party libraries, just generally making it easier for developers to collaborate. There's been a lot of focus on the developer experience, and that's awesome.</p>\n\n<p>I'm hoping that we also start to see more and more focus on the authoring experience. And I think we're seeing some of that; we see it with Claro now being the default admin theme, and it's such a huge improvement from what we had before, seeing the work that's happening with the Gin admin theme on top of Claro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And as you said, there are lots of tools, there are lots of people investing in this authoring space. Again, I think the developer persona has been first and foremost in Drupal for years, since the beginning. And I think we're starting to see more and more attention paid to the marketer and editorial staff, the writer, the journalist, the storyteller persona.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hopefully that continues to be a direction that Drupal focuses on. That's certainly the direction that my agency is focused on and where we want to take our work with Drupal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And then I think as far as how low code or no code plays into that, when we're not talking about a developer persona, no- and low code is very important, as we're talking about people who have very pressing, important work to do – and it's not coding.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>And for us Drupal people, that's often hard to get our heads around – like, what do you mean, pressing work is not coding? But for people who care about content and have important stories to tell, the work is the content. And the mission often is the content. And so in order to get that right, we have to be thinking in terms of low and no code.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>10. I remember the Driesnote from Portland and one thing that really resonated with me back then is that Drupal should be for ambitious site builders. A couple of years ago, we talked about ambitious digital experiences, which involved predominantly back-end work. And now that’s shifted to ambitious site builders.&nbsp;</h3>\n\n<h3>This could be understood as moving more into low code – not yet no code, though, since site builders typically still need to do some basic coding. But this is something that also needs to be taken into account, how Dries and the Drupal Association see Drupal evolving.</h3>\n\n<p>I agree with that. That idea worries me a little bit also because I think sometimes it's almost like we try to make the wrong things easy in Drupal. Creating a front end for Composer, for example, where developers, the people who are often using Composer to manage dependencies, are very comfortable using it.</p>\n\n<p>It's the same with Git. Who uses a UI for Git? I mean, there are some good ones out there that people use a little, but just about everyone uses the command line for Git. There’s no need for more than that.</p>\n\n<p>I’m more concerned with clients and organizations, especially in larger organization settings, e.g. a university where you have a core web services team who is managing the web presence for hundreds, sometimes thousands of websites across the university and trying to serve those internal customers.</p>\n\n<p>Where I want to see things go is where the people who own those sites, who are writing content for those sites or actually have to maintain them, are excited about the capabilities of this thing that they have.</p>\n\n<p>Often that's not quite the case. Often it's the site builder providing those services who's excited about that. And maybe that's just it. Maybe “Drupal's for ambitious site builders” is like a starting point, or it's along the way on that journey toward embracing those non-developer personas.</p>\n\n<p>Because at the end, it's all about content. It's all about publishing content. And the people who are actually publishing content, who have the important things to say, need to be empowered to actually do that.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h3>11. I almost feel like we’re going in this direction that maybe we as a Drupal community or people from Drupal agencies don't listen to marketing people enough. Or am I wrong here?</h3>\n\n<p>No, I don't think you're wrong. I think that's true. We still tend to live in this very developer-centric, developer-led world – let's call it the IT world. It's not per se the IT world, but let's say the complexity of Drupal would be better appreciated by an IT person as opposed to a content author or a marketing team.</p>\n\n<p>And this could cause friction because we did get buy-in with the IT team. But in the end, the IT team probably won't decide the how, what &amp; who, because it’s usually marketing budgets that decide on which way to go.</p>\n\n<p>I think we're too driven sometimes by the sheer capabilities of the product rather than how well it meets the needs of the people who are actually going to be working in the product, creating the content, pushing the content out.</p>\n\n<p>And often, the people who are getting most excited are the more technical personas or the CTO type – so, the technology segment in an organization; and the marketers or the writers are like, okay, I guess I can make this work.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>“I can make this work”, that tends to be their response. And I'd love to see it go further where it's an exciting and joyful experience for people who are actually creating content to do their work, to create the content.</p>\n\n<p>And there are other systems out there that are doing that.

As an enterprise-first CMS, it has always strived to cater to less technical users who needed to create more complex digital experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even older versions of the platform gave a lot of power to editors and site builders, but since version 8, each new release additionally prioritized the experience of this user group. In a sense, Drupal has thus become the ultimate no-code / low-code tool without ever being marketed as such.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we’ll take a deeper dive into the no-code / low-code site building features of Drupal, taking a look at how they have evolved throughout the platform’s history and what current developments are further establishing Drupal as a top no-code / low-code solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Website &amp; content management</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In essence, the key feature of a content management system is <strong>the ability to create websites and publish content</strong> either using very little code (<em>low code</em>) or <em>no code</em> at all.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Modern <a href=\"/podcast/chris-byers-empower-digital-maturity-through-no-code\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Chris Byers - Empower Digital Maturity Through No-Code\">no-code and low-code</a> tools are very much like traditional content management platforms, only with a greater focus on site building rather than content creation, and of course taking into account the more complex, multifaceted nature of today’s digital experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Drupal, the initial setup does require a certain level of technical expertise (as opposed to a CMS such as WordPress, for example), but after the website is set up, non-technical users are free to make custom configuration and create content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Granted, with earlier versions of Drupal, a no-code approach yielded a very bare-bones result, with only the most basic pages and content types; a low-code approach was needed for richer, more complex experiences, where developers enabled additional customization by adding and configuring contributed modules.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With each recent major release, however, Drupal’s no-code / low-code capabilities have been improving, with more and more contributed modules passing into core functionality and with several strategic initiatives to make Drupal both more beginner-friendly and more usable for non-technical users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of these initiatives is <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives/project-browser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Strategic Initiative: Project Browser\"><strong>Project Browser</strong></a>, which aims to greatly facilitate one of the key tasks site builders are faced with when working with Drupal – finding and installing contributed modules. The Project Browser initiative will enable easy access to and overview of contrib modules to users who aren’t as familiar with developer tooling and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Page building</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key pieces of functionality of a no-code / low-code tool is the ability to <strong>easily create rich landing pages</strong> and insert custom elements into these pages. These vary from more basic media assets to more complex interactive components such as forms, a ubiquitous element of the web.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially sought after for site builders today is <strong>efficient drag and drop page building functionality</strong>, one of the biggest selling points for platforms such as Wix or Squarespace.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drupal has long offered a very similar functionality. In Drupal 7, site builders and editors could make use of Panels to easily create sophisticated and interactive pages. Panels were very much alike modern-day low-code and no-code tools, even offering WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) and drag-and-drop editing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, during the time of D7, this functionality didn’t fit any of the main user types, as it was somewhat too advanced for basic site building and content creation, and not advanced enough for developers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of that, content created with Panels is pretty much impossible to efficiently migrate to a newer Drupal version without custom code, and as such the feature was neither well accepted nor further developed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Drupal 8 and beyond, the same functionality is provided via Blocks and Paragraphs. Blocks are less user-friendly and require more technical knowledge, and are as such a better fit for the administrator user types. They are typically reusable, have a more detailed logic and are closer to architectural elements than to content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paragraphs were intended as a more user-friendly version of Blocks, with a more intuitive user interface, and aimed primarily at content creators, editors and site builders. Unless specifically defined, they are one-off and not reusable. Putting it super bluntly: Blocks are closer to low-code tools, while Paragraphs are closer to no code.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More recently, site building with blocks has also been adopted by WordPress, the biggest open-source CMS, in the form of the <a href=\"/blog/interview-rich-tabor-godaddy-how-gutenberg-block-editor-changes-editing-experience\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with Rich Tabor of GoDaddy: How the Gutenberg block editor changes the editing experience\">Gutenberg block editor</a>.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, a successor of Panels, Layout Builder, is the Gutenberg equivalent in Drupal, offering editors an efficient way of working with blocks, specifically intended for the management of page layout and as such giving them more control over the presentation of their content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Layout Builder provides a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface as well as real-time content preview in the back end, two of the most essential features of no-code / low-code tools. Best of all, editors are able to <a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com/blog/designing-flexible-content-model-drupal-layout-builder-paragraphs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web: Layout Builder vs. Paragraphs: Designing a Flexible Content Model with Drupal\">leverage the Layout Builder in conjunction with Paragraphs</a>, using the former for more complex and the latter for more basic content types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides out-of-the-box Drupal functionality, there exist a number of custom site builder &amp; editor tools in the Drupal ecosystem, such as the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/dxpr_builder\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: DXPR Builder\">DXPR Builder</a>, or <a href=\"/blog/interview-justin-toupin-ceo-aten-design-group-enhancing-drupals-authoring-experience\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with Justin Toupin, CEO of Aten Design Group: Enhancing Drupal's authoring experience\">Layout Paragraphs</a> and the <a href=\"/blog/behind-scenes-look-mercury-editor-justin-toupin-aten-design\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Behind the scenes look into the Mercury Editor with Justin Toupin of Aten Design\">Mercury Editor</a> built by Aten Design Group.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"999ceda5-25c5-46f4-b1fc-2d149f3777d2\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>WYSIWYG and live preview</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The default editor of Drupal is <a href=\"https://ckeditor.com/case-studies/drupal/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CKEditor Success Stories: How Drupal saved its users millions of hours thanks to CKEditor\">CKEditor</a> (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/3308362\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: CKEditor 5 is now a stable core module\">migrating to the latest version 5 with Drupal 10</a>), an intuitive HTML editor with WYSIWYG functionality. It also allows previewing content (although not in real time) when using a coupled architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For headless / decoupled content management systems (Drupal included), previewing is still the number one desired feature, typically only provided in decoupled-first CMS platforms. However, the NextJS &amp; Drupal integration developed by Chapter Three, Next-Drupal, does enable live previewing, as does the GatsbyJS integration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Drupal is for ambitious site builders</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Drupal’s founder Dries Buytaert recently proposed that Drupal’s vision statement be adjusted from “Drupal is for ambitious digital experiences” to “<strong>Drupal is for ambitious site builders</strong>”. But what and who exactly is an <em>ambitious site builder</em>?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ambitious site builders are users that want more than just creating simple landing pages and basic content types, who need to be empowered to create richer, more complex digital experiences without in-depth knowledge of a programming language or a development framework.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An equivalent term from the broader digital ecosystem is a <strong>citizen developer</strong>: someone who is digitally native, and is at once user and content creator. The expectation is that, with the rise and evolution of low-code and no-code tools, pretty much everyone will be able to become a citizen developer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the abundance of frameworks and other tools for creating digital content/experiences, Drupal has fallen out of favor with new generations of developers and content creators, with many not even ever having heard of the framework, and many more having only done so in a negative light.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another major reason for this has been Drupal’s steep learning curve making it less user-friendly than equivalent tools – but recent strategic initiatives, such as the aforementioned Project Browser initiative, have been specifically designed to remedy this and bring Drupal closer to beginner / non-technical users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps even more important here is the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives/easy-out-of-the-box\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Strategic Initiative: Easy out of the box\"><strong>Easy out of the box</strong></a> initiative, the goal of which is to “<em>attract new and novice users to Drupal by improving the editorial experience from the moment Drupal is installed.</em>” It achieves this by providing the Media Library, the new admin theme Claro and the Layout Builder as system defaults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Vendor lock-in &amp; third-party integration</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the main issues of modern no-code / low-code tools is <a href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/how-low-code-no-code-are-changing-cx-design/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CMSWire: How Low-Code/No-Code Are Changing CX Design\">lacking support for third-party integrations</a>, as the functionality is very often limited to the core features of the platform.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, since migrating your content off such a platform can be incredibly difficult and time consuming, this typically means that you’re dependent on the platform provider for new functionality, leading to vendor lock-in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only does Drupal not have these problems with third-party integrations, it’s actually particularly streamlined for integrating with various third-party tools thanks to its strong API support.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of that, Drupal’s open-source nature means you have access to a wide range of freely available modules providing features not available in core (the number of which is diminishing thanks to all the recent optimizations to Drupal Core). It’s an <strong>API-first platform prioritizing integration</strong>, which has recently only become more pronounced thanks to its enterprise focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"0eb6ecea-9b4b-4fd6-8509-bf394fad7343\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As we have shown throughout this article, Drupal is and has for a long time been offering the same features that the top low-code / no-code tools prioritize today. Just like with many other technology trends, <strong>no code and low code are little more than new buzzwords</strong> for something that has long been a part of the ecosystem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"mailto:info@agiledrop.com\">Reach out to us at Agiledrop</a> if you’d like to learn more about how we can help you <a href=\"/drupal\" title=\"Agiledrop: Drupal development\">customize your Drupal platform</a> in order to empower your team as ambitious site builders.</p>\r\n",

In a sense, Drupal has thus become the ultimate no-code / low-code tool without ever being marketed as such.</p>\n\n<p>In this article, we’ll take a deeper dive into the no-code / low-code site building features of Drupal, taking a look at how they have evolved throughout the platform’s history and what current developments are further establishing Drupal as a top no-code / low-code solution.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Website &amp; content management</h2>\n\n<p>In essence, the key feature of a content management system is <strong>the ability to create websites and publish content</strong> either using very little code (<em>low code</em>) or <em>no code</em> at all. </p>\n\n<p>Modern <a href=\"/podcast/chris-byers-empower-digital-maturity-through-no-code\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Chris Byers - Empower Digital Maturity Through No-Code\">no-code and low-code</a> tools are very much like traditional content management platforms, only with a greater focus on site building rather than content creation, and of course taking into account the more complex, multifaceted nature of today’s digital experiences.</p>\n\n<p>With Drupal, the initial setup does require a certain level of technical expertise (as opposed to a CMS such as WordPress, for example), but after the website is set up, non-technical users are free to make custom configuration and create content.</p>\n\n<p>Granted, with earlier versions of Drupal, a no-code approach yielded a very bare-bones result, with only the most basic pages and content types; a low-code approach was needed for richer, more complex experiences, where developers enabled additional customization by adding and configuring contributed modules. </p>\n\n<p>With each recent major release, however, Drupal’s no-code / low-code capabilities have been improving, with more and more contributed modules passing into core functionality and with several strategic initiatives to make Drupal both more beginner-friendly and more usable for non-technical users.</p>\n\n<p>One of these initiatives is <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives/project-browser\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Strategic Initiative: Project Browser\"><strong>Project Browser</strong></a>, which aims to greatly facilitate one of the key tasks site builders are faced with when working with Drupal – finding and installing contributed modules. The Project Browser initiative will enable easy access to and overview of contrib modules to users who aren’t as familiar with developer tooling and processes.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Page building</h2>\n\n<p>One of the key pieces of functionality of a no-code / low-code tool is the ability to <strong>easily create rich landing pages</strong> and insert custom elements into these pages. These vary from more basic media assets to more complex interactive components such as forms, a ubiquitous element of the web.</p>\n\n<p>Especially sought after for site builders today is <strong>efficient drag and drop page building functionality</strong>, one of the biggest selling points for platforms such as Wix or Squarespace.</p>\n\n<p>Drupal has long offered a very similar functionality. In Drupal 7, site builders and editors could make use of Panels to easily create sophisticated and interactive pages. Panels were very much alike modern-day low-code and no-code tools, even offering WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) and drag-and-drop editing. </p>\n\n<p>However, during the time of D7, this functionality didn’t fit any of the main user types, as it was somewhat too advanced for basic site building and content creation, and not advanced enough for developers. </p>\n\n<p>On top of that, content created with Panels is pretty much impossible to efficiently migrate to a newer Drupal version without custom code, and as such the feature was neither well accepted nor further developed.</p>\n\n<p>In Drupal 8 and beyond, the same functionality is provided via Blocks and Paragraphs. Blocks are less user-friendly and require more technical knowledge, and are as such a better fit for the administrator user types. They are typically reusable, have a more detailed logic and are closer to architectural elements than to content.</p>\n\n<p>Paragraphs were intended as a more user-friendly version of Blocks, with a more intuitive user interface, and aimed primarily at content creators, editors and site builders. Unless specifically defined, they are one-off and not reusable. Putting it super bluntly: Blocks are closer to low-code tools, while Paragraphs are closer to no code. </p>\n\n<p>More recently, site building with blocks has also been adopted by WordPress, the biggest open-source CMS, in the form of the <a href=\"/blog/interview-rich-tabor-godaddy-how-gutenberg-block-editor-changes-editing-experience\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with Rich Tabor of GoDaddy: How the Gutenberg block editor changes the editing experience\">Gutenberg block editor</a>. </p>\n\n<p>Interestingly, a successor of Panels, Layout Builder, is the Gutenberg equivalent in Drupal, offering editors an efficient way of working with blocks, specifically intended for the management of page layout and as such giving them more control over the presentation of their content.</p>\n\n<p>The Layout Builder provides a user-friendly drag-and-drop interface as well as real-time content preview in the back end, two of the most essential features of no-code / low-code tools. Best of all, editors are able to <a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com/blog/designing-flexible-content-model-drupal-layout-builder-paragraphs\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web: Layout Builder vs. Paragraphs: Designing a Flexible Content Model with Drupal\">leverage the Layout Builder in conjunction with Paragraphs</a>, using the former for more complex and the latter for more basic content types.</p>\n\n<p>Besides out-of-the-box Drupal functionality, there exist a number of custom site builder &amp; editor tools in the Drupal ecosystem, such as the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/dxpr_builder\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: DXPR Builder\">DXPR Builder</a>, or <a href=\"/blog/interview-justin-toupin-ceo-aten-design-group-enhancing-drupals-authoring-experience\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with Justin Toupin, CEO of Aten Design Group: Enhancing Drupal's authoring experience\">Layout Paragraphs</a> and the <a href=\"/blog/behind-scenes-look-mercury-editor-justin-toupin-aten-design\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Behind the scenes look into the Mercury Editor with Justin Toupin of Aten Design\">Mercury Editor</a> built by Aten Design Group.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<article data-align=\"center\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/medium_800/public/2022-10/Drupal%20low%20code%20%20no%20code%20page%20building.png?itok=309HO7bx\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Different content management icons on light green/blue background\" loading=\"lazy\" /></article><p> </p>\n\n<h2>WYSIWYG and live preview</h2>\n\n<p>The default editor of Drupal is <a href=\"https://ckeditor.com/case-studies/drupal/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CKEditor Success Stories: How Drupal saved its users millions of hours thanks to CKEditor\">CKEditor</a> (<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/3308362\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: CKEditor 5 is now a stable core module\">migrating to the latest version 5 with Drupal 10</a>), an intuitive HTML editor with WYSIWYG functionality. It also allows previewing content (although not in real time) when using a coupled architecture.</p>\n\n<p>For headless / decoupled content management systems (Drupal included), previewing is still the number one desired feature, typically only provided in decoupled-first CMS platforms. However, the NextJS &amp; Drupal integration developed by Chapter Three, Next-Drupal, does enable live previewing, as does the GatsbyJS integration.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Drupal is for ambitious site builders</h2>\n\n<p>Drupal’s founder Dries Buytaert recently proposed that Drupal’s vision statement be adjusted from “Drupal is for ambitious digital experiences” to “<strong>Drupal is for ambitious site builders</strong>”. But what and who exactly is an <em>ambitious site builder</em>?</p>\n\n<p>Ambitious site builders are users that want more than just creating simple landing pages and basic content types, who need to be empowered to create richer, more complex digital experiences without in-depth knowledge of a programming language or a development framework.</p>\n\n<p>An equivalent term from the broader digital ecosystem is a <strong>citizen developer</strong>: someone who is digitally native, and is at once user and content creator. The expectation is that, with the rise and evolution of low-code and no-code tools, pretty much everyone will be able to become a citizen developer.</p>\n\n<p>Due to the abundance of frameworks and other tools for creating digital content/experiences, Drupal has fallen out of favor with new generations of developers and content creators, with many not even ever having heard of the framework, and many more having only done so in a negative light.</p>\n\n<p>Another major reason for this has been Drupal’s steep learning curve making it less user-friendly than equivalent tools – but recent strategic initiatives, such as the aforementioned Project Browser initiative, have been specifically designed to remedy this and bring Drupal closer to beginner / non-technical users.</p>\n\n<p>Perhaps even more important here is the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/about/core/strategic-initiatives/easy-out-of-the-box\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Strategic Initiative: Easy out of the box\"><strong>Easy out of the box</strong></a> initiative, the goal of which is to “<em>attract new and novice users to Drupal by improving the editorial experience from the moment Drupal is installed.</em>” It achieves this by providing the Media Library, the new admin theme Claro and the Layout Builder as system defaults.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Vendor lock-in &amp; third-party integration</h2>\n\n<p>One of the main issues of modern no-code / low-code tools is <a href=\"https://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/how-low-code-no-code-are-changing-cx-design/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CMSWire: How Low-Code/No-Code Are Changing CX Design\">lacking support for third-party integrations</a>, as the functionality is very often limited to the core features of the platform. </p>\n\n<p>However, since migrating your content off such a platform can be incredibly difficult and time consuming, this typically means that you’re dependent on the platform provider for new functionality, leading to vendor lock-in.</p>\n\n<p>Not only does Drupal not have these problems with third-party integrations, it’s actually particularly streamlined for integrating with various third-party tools thanks to its strong API support.</p>\n\n<p>On top of that, Drupal’s open-source nature means you have access to a wide range of freely available modules providing features not available in core (the number of which is diminishing thanks to all the recent optimizations to Drupal Core). It’s an <strong>API-first platform prioritizing integration</strong>, which has recently only become more pronounced thanks to its enterprise focus.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<article data-align=\"center\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/medium_800/public/2022-10/Drupal%20low%20code%20%20no%20code%20final.png?itok=k5U2ZXtz\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Abstract image with a lot of screens in hues of purple, violet and black\" loading=\"lazy\" /></article><p> </p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>As we have shown throughout this article, Drupal is and has for a long time been offering the same features that the top low-code / no-code tools prioritize today. Just like with many other technology trends, <strong>no code and low code are little more than new buzzwords</strong> for something that has long been a part of the ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"mailto:info@agiledrop.com\">Reach out to us at Agiledrop</a> if you’d like to learn more about how we can help you <a href=\"/drupal\" title=\"Agiledrop: Drupal development\">customize your Drupal platform</a> in order to empower your team as ambitious site builders.</p>\n",

One of these is <a href=\"/clients/media-publishing\" title=\"Agiledrop: Helping media &amp; publishing companies deliver exceptional digital platforms\">media and publishing</a>, which is able to take full advantage of Drupal’s streamlined editorial functionality and media management.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this article, we’ll take a deeper dive into what makes Drupal such a great fit for media and publishing companies, how it impacts their position in the current digital economy, and what Drupal initiatives we can expect to further optimize features for media and publishing. Let’s get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Top-tier media management</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Media was added into core Drupal in version 8. Ever since then, one of the platform’s strongest features has been its <a href=\"https://drupalize.me/tutorial/overview-media-management-drupal?p=3422\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupalize.me: Overview: Media Management in Drupal\">media management capabilities</a>, which in core consist of the Media and Media Library modules.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This has been further enhanced with version 9 which added WYSIWYG functionality to the Media Library. Drupal 10, slated for release in December 2022, will feature an updated version of CKEditor, the text editor used by Drupal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Enterprise-ready</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past few years, Drupal has been positioning itself more and more strongly as an <a href=\"/blog/drupal-9-new-era-enterprise-digital-experiences\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Drupal 9 - a new era for enterprise digital experiences\">enterprise-first content management platform</a>, moving away from simpler monolithic use cases into growing support for modern digital experiences and architectural trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Under the next few points we’ll break down the enterprise-ready features of Drupal 9 which are particularly relevant for the media &amp; publishing industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Commitment to accessibility</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Accessibility has become an essential element of a good digital user experience. Media &amp; publishing has to take care to make content accessible to all users, and they need platforms that will enable this for content creators and editors in addition to developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agiledrop.com/blog/drupal-number-one-open-source-cms-accessibility\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Drupal - the number one open-source CMS for accessibility\">Drupal has made great strides to be accessible out of the box</a>, with an abundance of accessibility-first functionality available in core and a strict adherence to WCAG 2.1; on top of that,&nbsp;it also features a number of freely available <a href=\"/blog/top-10-drupal-accessibility-modules\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Top 10 Drupal Accessibility Modules\">accessibility modules</a> which are contributed and vetted by community members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Streamlined content editor UX in Drupal 9</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest improvements of Drupal 9 has been the <a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com/blog/drupal-8-vs-drupal-9-more-features-content-editors\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web: Drupal 8 vs. Drupal 9: More Features for Content Editors\">streamlined administration user experience</a>, owed in large part to the new and refreshed admin theme Claro. Claro is an enhancement of the already editor-friendly admin theme, featuring a more modern and less cluttered interface.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drupal 9 also included the Layout Builder functionality in core which introduced easy drag-and-drop editing and additionally streamlined creation of diverse content types.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is particularly relevant considering the rise of no-code / low-code website builders, e.g.&nbsp;Wix, which are gaining ground in some enterprise settings as well. The addition of Layout Builder brings the content editing experience closer to that with which users have familiarized themselves when using Wix or a similar tool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. API-first</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Due to the innovation in digital experiences, multichannel / omnichannel publishing has become a top desired functionality for media &amp; publishing. Content management platforms have started providing <a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com/blog/wheres-your-head-case-and-against-headless-cms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web: Where’s Your Head? The Case For (and Against) Headless CMS\">headless / decoupled</a> capabilities, with some fully decoupled systems altogether abandoning traditional content management functionality in favor of these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since Drupal 8, Drupal has strived to be an API-first CMS, its streamlined support for REST and JSON:API being a huge boon for decoupling the front end. This strong API support enables easy <a href=\"/blog/decoupling-drupal-react-vue\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Decoupling Drupal: React &amp; Vue\">decoupling with React or Vue</a>, as well as Next-Drupal for example. The recent Decoupled Menus initiative has been another important step in bringing JavaScript closer to the Drupal world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. High-level multilingual capabilities</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Another sought-after functionality in media &amp; publishing is the ability to easily deliver content at scale to international audiences. Here Drupal shines again thanks to its high-level multilingual capabilities, providing not only smooth translation workflows but also ample options for content localization and custom page layouts for different languages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Caters easily to complex publishing workflows</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A major draw of Drupal’s for content managers and editors is the flexibility of publishing workflows. The platform enables the creation of drafts and revisions, with custom publishing times and approval processes based on elaborate customization of user roles and according permissions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As mentioned previously, Drupal also allows for multichannel publishing as an API-based headless content platform. All of this customizability means media &amp; publishing organizations can tailor the entire experience to their particular workflows and needs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Latest updates &amp; initiatives</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to all these features, there are a number of other recent initiatives and innovations in Drupal that are benefiting organizations in media &amp; publishing. We already highlighted the Decoupled Menus strategic initiative; also important is the Easy Out of the Box initiative, which as its name suggests aims to streamline the out-of-the-box experience for less technical users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another notable novelty is the announcement Dries Buytaert made in his DrupalCon Portland 2022 keynote speech to evolve Drupal’s vision statement to <a href=\"https://dri.es/drupal-is-for-ambitious-site-builders\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries: Drupal is for ambitious site builders\">“Drupal is for ambitious site builders”</a>, a more specific version of the previous focus on ambitious websites intended to empower the new generation of site builders who are used to working with modern tools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And, last but certainly not least, we need to mention the recent industry shift from web content management to digital experience management, where Drupal is the leading open-source platform, with <a href=\"https://www.acquia.com/resources/report/gartner-dxp-magic-quadrant\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Acquia: Acquia Named a Leader in the 2022 Gartner® Magic Quadrant™ for DXP\">Acquia also being recognized as a DXP leader by Gartner</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given how essential it is for the media &amp; publishing industry to keep up with latest digital trends lest it fall behind the times, having a platform which ticks all the traditional boxes while also catering to the creation of more complex/modern multichannel experiences is definitely a huge boon. Add to that Drupal’s open-source status and it’s really a no-brainer why it is the top CMS platform for news, media &amp; publishing organizations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Thunder, the Drupal distribution tailored to media &amp; publishing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>While Drupal will by itself give you all the functionality that we’ve highlighted in this article, you can also go a step further and choose a content management system that’s tailored specifically to the needs of media &amp; publishing companies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Developed by Hubert Burda Media and released as open source, <a href=\"/publishing-cms-checklist\" title=\"Agiledrop: Publishing CMS checklist\">Thunder</a> was designed specifically as a CMS for professional publishing and is now used by numerous businesses across a number of industries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Drupal’s highly capable out-of-the-box editorial capabilities, together with its open-source nature, make it an ideal CMS choice for any <a href=\"/clients/media-publishing\" title=\"Agiledrop: Helping media &amp; publishing companies deliver exceptional digital platforms\">media / publishing</a> business.

Here are some of our top picks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3 id=\"heading-1\">Open source runs on non-code contributions</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We’re kicking off this month’s selection with an article that’s more broadly about open source rather than specifically about Drupal, in which <a href=\"/blog/interview-john-piccozi-co-host-weekly-podcast-talking-drupal\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with John Piccozi, co-host of the weekly podcast Talking Drupal\">John Picozzi</a> talks about non-code contributions to open-source projects. The article is a recap of John’s session from the recent DrupalCon NA, a video of which is also included in the article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>John stresses the importance of non-code contributions in addition to contributing code. He discusses how contribution to Drupal has evolved over the years, what drives community members to contribute, and how they can address common hesitations of early contributors and get involved in their open-source project of choice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource.com/article/22/8/non-code-contribution-powers-open-source\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Open Source: Open source runs on non-code contributions\"><strong>Read more about non-code contribution to open source</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal 9: Creating A Category Menu Using Derivers</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next article is a guide on how to generate custom menu links through the use of menu derivers, coming from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipnorton42\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Philip Norton Twitter\">Philip Norton</a> on his blog on <a href=\"https://www.hashbangcode.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#! code homepage\">#! code</a>. In the first half of the article, he shows the steps needed to set up a menu deriver class to add links to corresponding nodes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With this menu deriver, you’re able to create a category menu system based on a list of taxonomy terms from a vocabulary. Philip also shows how to trigger the rebuilding of the menu in case of caching issues, then finishes with a list of possible link properties and some common examples of menu derivers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.hashbangcode.com/article/drupal-9-creating-category-menu-using-derivers\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#! code: Drupal 9: Creating A Category Menu Using Derivers\"><strong>Read more about menu derivers in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Responsive images in Drupal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The third article on our August selection comes from <a href=\"https://www.civicuk.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CIVIC homepage\">CIVIC</a> and deals with using Drupal’s Responsive Images module to adjust the size of images based on the screen size of the device it’s viewed on, and thus improve the experience of users browsing the website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make images responsive, you first need to set up breakpoints, create an image style for each breakpoint, then make the images styles responsive using the Responsive Images module. Also, if you prefer, you’re able to manage images and make them responsive through Media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.civicuk.com/blog-item/responsive-images-drupal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"CIVIC: Responsive images in Drupal\"><strong>Read more about responsive images in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Maxlength Module 2.0 Out Now - Set Character Limits on Your Drupal Website</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have a post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/claybolto\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Clayton Dewey Twitter\">Clayton Dewey</a> of <a href=\"https://devcollaborative.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"DevCollaborative homepage\">DevCollaborative</a> about the new release of the Maxlength Module of which they became maintainers in 2021. Maxlength 2.0 is now the first stable release for Drupal versions 8 and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the biggest updates is a more intuitive, user-friendly configuration experience. Other improvements include a rewrite of the help page, character miscount fixes, a fix of the soft limit for plain text fields bug, and more.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Clayton also includes a section on the different options for updating from the older version of Maxlength, and finishes with a thank you to all community members that have worked on the module and some next steps for it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://devcollaborative.com/blog/maxlength-module-20-out-now-set-character-limits-your-drupal-website\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"DevCollaborative: Maxlength Module 2.0 Out Now - Set Character Limits on Your Drupal Website\"><strong>Read more about the Maxlength module</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal: cache tags for all, regardless your backend</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next article, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmdmatt\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matt Glaman Twitter\">Matt Glaman</a> writes about the frequent issues with cache invalidation and how they are addressed in Drupal. Since Drupal 8, this has been done through the Cache API with cache tags.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Matt first explains what cache tags are, or rather, how they are different from cache identifiers, before providing more information about PSR-6/PSR-16 caching standards and how different technologies handle caching.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the final sections of his article, he dives into the specifics of how Drupal emulates cache tags and gives a more concrete example of how cache metadata can be used to only invalidate the relevant page caches of a dependent object which has been modified.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://mglaman.dev/blog/drupal-cache-tags-all-regardless-your-backend\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matt Glaman: Drupal: cache tags for all, regardless your backend\"><strong>Read more about cache invalidation in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Where’s Your Head? The Case For (and Against) Headless CMS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue with an article about headless content management systems by <a href=\"/blog/interview-suzanne-dergacheva-evolving-web-skys-limit-drupal\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with Suzanne Dergacheva of Evolving Web: The sky's the limit with Drupal\">Suzanne Dergacheva</a> of <a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web homepage\">Evolving Web</a>. She starts off by explaining what it is before breaking down the key benefits of a decoupled architecture: speed, scalability, and security.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She also takes a look at the other side of the argument by addressing the disadvantages of going headless and cases where it might be best to stick with a traditional architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best of both worlds, as Suzanne highlights, could be using a hybrid / progressively decoupled architecture, with a content-as-a-service API. Thanks to its API-first approach, Drupal is able to cater both to a fully decoupled or a hybrid architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com/blog/wheres-your-head-case-and-against-headless-cms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web: Where’s Your Head?

Other improvements include a rewrite of the help page, character miscount fixes, a fix of the soft limit for plain text fields bug, and more.</p>\n\n<p>Clayton also includes a section on the different options for updating from the older version of Maxlength, and finishes with a thank you to all community members that have worked on the module and some next steps for it.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://devcollaborative.com/blog/maxlength-module-20-out-now-set-character-limits-your-drupal-website\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"DevCollaborative: Maxlength Module 2.0 Out Now - Set Character Limits on Your Drupal Website\"><strong>Read more about the Maxlength module</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Drupal: cache tags for all, regardless your backend</h3>\n\n<p>In the next article, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/nmdmatt\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matt Glaman Twitter\">Matt Glaman</a> writes about the frequent issues with cache invalidation and how they are addressed in Drupal. Since Drupal 8, this has been done through the Cache API with cache tags. </p>\n\n<p>Matt first explains what cache tags are, or rather, how they are different from cache identifiers, before providing more information about PSR-6/PSR-16 caching standards and how different technologies handle caching.</p>\n\n<p>In the final sections of his article, he dives into the specifics of how Drupal emulates cache tags and gives a more concrete example of how cache metadata can be used to only invalidate the relevant page caches of a dependent object which has been modified.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mglaman.dev/blog/drupal-cache-tags-all-regardless-your-backend\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Matt Glaman: Drupal: cache tags for all, regardless your backend\"><strong>Read more about cache invalidation in Drupal</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Where’s Your Head? The Case For (and Against) Headless CMS</h3>\n\n<p>We continue with an article about headless content management systems by <a href=\"/blog/interview-suzanne-dergacheva-evolving-web-skys-limit-drupal\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with Suzanne Dergacheva of Evolving Web: The sky's the limit with Drupal\">Suzanne Dergacheva</a> of <a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web homepage\">Evolving Web</a>. She starts off by explaining what it is before breaking down the key benefits of a decoupled architecture: speed, scalability, and security.</p>\n\n<p>She also takes a look at the other side of the argument by addressing the disadvantages of going headless and cases where it might be best to stick with a traditional architecture.</p>\n\n<p>The best of both worlds, as Suzanne highlights, could be using a hybrid / progressively decoupled architecture, with a content-as-a-service API. Thanks to its API-first approach, Drupal is able to cater both to a fully decoupled or a hybrid architecture.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://evolvingweb.com/blog/wheres-your-head-case-and-against-headless-cms\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Evolving Web: Where’s Your Head?

          "value": "<p>Gone are the days of relying exclusively on traditional marketing methods. In today's world, you need to be able to reach your customers through many channels. An <a href=\"https://cjp.broadsoft.com/blog/outbound-campaign-management/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Cisco Customer Journey Platform: Outbound Campaign Management\">outbound campaign platform</a> is a powerful tool that can help you do that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can target your customers through email, social media, and more. It can also help you run your marketing by ensuring easier access to your target market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To maximize its impact, you need to customize it to fit your needs. There are several ways to do this, including using the omnichannel contact center. These options help firms to tailor the outbound campaign platform to their clients and customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be challenging to choose the option that suits you the best from the many available ones. Here are 7 options you can choose from to customize your outbound campaign platform.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Omnichannel Contact Centers</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The contact center market has recently shifted to an \"omnichannel\" contact center. An <a href=\"https://www.brightpattern.com/omnichannel-contact-center/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bright Pattern: Omnichannel Contact Center Software\">omnichannel contact center</a> provides customers with many channels to reach out for help. This also includes newer channels like chatbots and social media.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It provides customers with a seamless experience regardless of their channel. This means agents must be set up to handle inquiries from any channel and to get data from many channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are numerous benefits to this type of customer service. For example, customers who use many channels are more satisfied and less likely to churn. Additionally, it can help reduce support costs by allowing agents to resolve inquiries faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of that, using an omnichannel contact center can increase sales as buyers are more likely to buy from a business with a good customer experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Omnichannel Contact Center Salesforce</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The SaaS platform Salesforce is <a href=\"https://www.salesforce.com/solutions/industries/retail/resources/omni-channel-marketing/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Salesforce: The Growing Power of Omnichannel Marketing\">a trendy choice</a> for an omnichannel contact center. The outbound campaign platform is easily customizable, making it a fitting choice for firms of all sizes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Salesforce platform is scalable so that it can grow with your business. This includes the ability to tailor the system to match your brand, product, or service. You can also integrate it with your existing infrastructure.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, it offers detailed support and records to help you make the most of your investment. It is an excellent option for firms that want to use the power of the Salesforce CRM to create an enriching experience for clients.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This system can provide businesses with various reports and analytics tools. This helps them understand customer behavior and improve customer service.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Contact centers are turning to artificial intelligence (AI) to change outbound campaign platforms. <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/service/artificial-intelligence-call-center\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hubspot: Artificial Intelligence Call Center: How is AI Used in Call Centers [+How Will AI Impact Customer Service]\">Using AI</a>, contact centers can tailor their campaigns to target customer base segments.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AI helps send custom messages and even automate follow-up and meeting scheduling tasks. Also, AI provides contact centers valuable insights into customer behavior and preferences. This is typically used to improve the customer experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, AI is also used to analyze customer behavior patterns and predict future needs. With the help of AI, contact centers can improve customer loyalty and increase sales and revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Contact Centers That Use Live Chat</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Live chat is a tool that contact centers can use to tailor the portals for their outgoing adverts. This enables real-time communication between agents and clients, improving client experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1edf4e30-e1eb-4cef-813c-d7da1c6c5748\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>It allows customers to get answers to questions without waiting to send an email.

Here is an overview of our favorite July articles.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Automatic Updates in Drupal: How Things are Going With the #1 Requested Feature</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The first article in this month’s overview comes from <a href=\"https://imagexmedia.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ImageX homepage\">ImageX</a> and gives an update on the progress and functioning of the Automatic Updates initiative, which is the number one requested feature as Dries Buytaert announced during his keynote at DrupalCon Portland in April, since website updates are one of Drupal’s biggest issues for customers and users.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The article starts off with a more general section with information about the initiative’s recent progress and future plans. The larger portion of the article is then dedicated to an overview of the different features and modules that comprise the Automatic Updates initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://imagexmedia.com/blog/automatic-updates-drupal/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"ImageX: Automatic Updates in Drupal: How Things are Going With the #1 Requested Feature\"><strong>Read more about Automatic Updates in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>An Introduction to Design Patterns in PHP (and leveraging it in Drupal)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have an introduction to PHP design patterns and making use of them in Drupal, written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mohammedfarhaz1\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mohammed Farhaz Twitter\">Mohammed Farhaz</a> of <a href=\"https://www.specbee.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Specbee homepage\">Specbee</a>. In the first half of the article, he describes design patterns in PHP and why you should use them, and provides a breakdown of the most widely used design patterns in PHP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second half of Mohammed’s article is dedicated to using design patterns in Drupal 9. Specifically, these are object-oriented programming, dependency injection, the factory pattern and the singleton pattern. He finishes with a more in-depth overview and examples of dependency injections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.specbee.com/blogs/php-design-patterns-in-drupal-9\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Specbee: An Introduction to Design Patterns in PHP (and leveraging it in Drupal)\"><strong>Read more about PHP design patterns (in Drupal)</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Composer Managed Custom WordPress &amp; Drupal Dependencies</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next post, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/daggerhart\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jonathan Daggerhart Twitter\">Jonathan Daggerhart</a> presents the Composer Merge Plugin, which enables more streamlined dependency management for Drupal and WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This plugin allows developers the ideal scenario, as Jonathan puts it, of having each custom module or plugin define its own dependency packages, which results in better maintained relationships between these custom functionalities and their dependencies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He shows the examples for both WordPress plugins and themes, as well as for Drupal modules and themes, and closes with a brief overview of the main takeaways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.daggerhartlab.com/composer-managed-custom-wordpress-drupal-dependencies/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"DaggerhartLab: Composer Managed Custom WordPress &amp; Drupal Dependencies\"><strong>Read more about the Composer Merge Plugin</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Supporting an unknown amount of menu items within Olivero’s menu</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue with a post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeherchel\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mike Herchel Twitter\">Mike Herchel</a>, lead developer of Drupal’s new default front-end theme Olivero, who shows how to enable support for an undefined amount of menu items in a menu built in Olivero.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A straightforward solution would be to default to the mobile menu style over the desktop style when there’s a large amount of menu items, but as Mike points out, this can still result in problems with presentation if you’re not sure how exactly the items will fit the viewport.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The better solution is to use CSS and JavaScript to enable “always on” mobile navigation, then add an event listener to display the desktop version of the menu where necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://herchel.com/articles/supporting-unknown-amount-menu-items-within-oliveros-menu\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Herchel.com: Supporting an unknown amount of menu items within Olivero’s menu\"><strong>Read more about handling an unknown amount of menu items in Olivero</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Rediscovering Balance in Drupal Core Contribution with #bugsmash</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we have a great post by <a href=\"/blog/interview-amber-matz-how-will-drupals-greatest-challenge-shape-its-future\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with Amber Matz: How will Drupal's greatest challenge shape its future?\">Amber Himes Matz</a> of <a href=\"https://drupalize.me\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupalize.me homepage\">Drupalize.me</a> who shares how she was able to find a way to contribute to Drupal core that works best for her through the Bug Smash Initiative on the #bugsmash channel on Drupal Slack.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way the initiative works is through issue triaging – providing feedback and updating issue metadata to facilitate the job of committers and contributors – which is a great way to tackle the large amount of outstanding bugs in Drupal, also perfect for developers who want to contribute but don’t have a lot of time to devote to doing so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://drupalize.me/blog/rediscovering-balance-drupal-core-contribution-bugsmash\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupalize.me: Rediscovering Balance in Drupal Core Contribution with #bugsmash\"><strong>Read more about issue triaging and the Bug Smash initiative</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Exporting Drupal body classes to use with Tailwind CSS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next post, written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/opdavies\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Oliver Davies Twitter\">Oliver Davies</a>, is about exporting content from Drupal’s body classes so that it can be used by Tailwind CSS’s JIT (just in time) compiler and PurgeCSS. One approach is to add the classes to a safelist, and extract them to a file if necessary.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another option is to use a custom Drush command to automatically generate the safelist based on the database contents. As Oliver shows, this is done through creating a new PHP class within a custom module, then injecting the database service and completing the handle method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oliverdavies.uk/blog/drupal-body-classes-tailwind-css/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Oliver Davies: Exporting Drupal body classes to use with Tailwind CSS\"><strong>Read more about using Drupal body field content with Tailwind</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Manage Terms in Bulk using Taxonomy Manager in Drupal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Approaching the end of this month’s overview, we have a guide for managing terms in bulk with the Taxonomy Manager module, written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ivanzugec\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Ivan Zugec Twitter\">Ivan Zugec</a> of <a href=\"https://www.webwash.net\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WebWash homepage\">WebWash</a>.

          "value": "<p>The Internet is an essential component of modern life. There isn't a single element of our lives that hasn't been changed or altered by it. Everyone who utilizes the Internet is acquainted with the idea of a website. Websites constitute the majority of the Internet from a non-technical standpoint. In businesses, it can either strengthen your relationship with clients or break it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Is your website giving the right information when looked at for the first time? Does it tell the client what type of business you are running? Do they get the idea of what essentials are integrated into your business? Is your website easy to navigate and understand? If the answer is NO, you need some changes in your <a href=\"https://m.webdesign-inspiration.com/web-designs/style/classy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Web Design Inspirations: 24 Best Classy Website Ideas\">web design</a> to make it more clear and more effective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here we are going to have a look at the tips that are going to help you design a website that is at the top of the game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Have A Plan</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now that you've admitted that your site needs some improvements, devise a strategy for correcting them. You can use <a href=\"https://www.brightidea.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bright Idea homepage\">innovation management</a> software to put your ideas in place. Innovation management software can help you out in many circumstances. From gathering the ideas from every new and old mind of the company to deciding how to implement the specified idea.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is a fairly recent development, but there is no doubt that innovation software has helped enterprise-level businesses in the evaluation of new ideas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With the rise in popularity of social sharing platforms and cloud computing, innovation management software is helping businesses to a whole new level. You can also get the advantage of using it to put your top ideas in place. An excellent way to start is by seeing the pattern of what your customers look for in the first place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then, use this information to develop your approach. It will help you to pinpoint the areas your users interact with the most. A well-thought-out plan for how you want your website to appear will put you in the right direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Well-Organized Navigation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Navigation is essential when creating a website. It's a map that illustrates the main locations that customers can visit. You can get this data by utilizing innovative software integrated with your website. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It's a fact that <a href=\"https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13174-014-0008-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Journal of Internet Services and Applications: A survey on predicting the popularity of web content\">50% of internet users</a> don't know how to use the standard menu. With the right ways, you can lower the percentage, and your customers will be able to find what they are looking for. One of the best ways of doing this is to improve the navigation of your webpage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organised navigation will communicate to the client that you want them to have a good time here. This eventually will raise the number of people visiting your website on an average basis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Visual Organization</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A visual hierarchy determines which component needs to stand out visually on your website. These critical elements should be prioritised. When developing a website, it is vital to use the proper color palette and aesthetic features.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your website's layout and design can increase its impact. Depending on your priorities, you can use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/page-layout-design\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hubspot: The Basics of Page Layout Design (+25 Page Layout Design Ideas)\">various different layouts</a>, such as the N or Z pattern.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should be clear about how you want your website to look and be willing to think outside the box to make necessary changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Excellent Readability</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Website readability assesses how effortless it is for viewers to comprehend the text on a website fully. Your website should be easy to read. Visitors often leave the website within the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/chartbeat-website-engagement-data-nj\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hubspot: What Is the Average Time Spent On a Website? [+ How to Improve It]\">first 10-20 seconds</a> if the readability is not good. You must ensure the text does not blend in with the background color.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is best to have a website with a rank between 60-90. This equates to a grade level between 6th and 8th grades. Aside from aesthetics and structure, the speech of the text is important. It should be straightforward, simple, and spelled correctly.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hard and complex words or sentences will confuse your consumers. It is better to go for a simple language that everyone can understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Make Pricing Accessible</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Imagine a scenario where you've arrived at a website looking for idea management tools or software and decided which one is ideal for you. The last step is to consider the cost. But what if I tell you that all the information about the premium plans is hidden and not accessible?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You have to communicate to get all the details. Are you not going to be frustrated by now? Do not go down that path; you are here to help your customers, not to make things difficult for them. Always make sure that pricing information is transparent and easily accessible.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Optimization for Mobile Devices</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Mobile phones alone account for more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Statista: Percentage of mobile device website traffic worldwide from 1st quarter 2015 to 2nd quarter 2022\">51 percent of global website visitors</a>. Most people on the internet use mobile phones for browsing. &nbsp;As a result, you can access any webpage you want at any time and from anywhere. When developing a website, consider the comfort of mobile phone users. Many websites are not well optimized for use on mobile devices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internet is full of tools that help optimize your website and offer quality advice. Google offers tools to get to know your website response time and help you easily access it on mobile devices&nbsp;and that could potentially increase the <a href=\"https://betterstack.com/community/comparisons/incident-management-tools/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Better Stack: 5 Most Used Incident Management Tools (Reviewed &amp; Ranked)\">amount of incidents</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7.&nbsp;Remove All Distractions</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Certain aspects of your website will draw attention away from the benefit and message you're striving to convey. <a href=\"https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/#:~:text=The%20average%20attention%20span,digitalized%20lifestyle%20on%20the%20brain.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Time.com: You Now Have a Shorter Attention Span Than a Goldfish\">A study by Microsoft Corp</a> claims that humans can focus for only eight seconds, so it is best to use this to your advantage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You should know what the client will look for on the website and construct a layout that helps them. You should not distract them from their main purpose of visiting. After all, if you help them, they will return for more.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nIt is also critical to avoid using too many on-page visuals or interplay. It is confusing to navigate through a page and see many buttons flickering. Adding too many icons and symbols will decrease the quality of your webpage. You need to draw attention to important things for you and your client. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Utilize Social Proof</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no doubt that <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/small-business/project-management/articles/social-media-project-management/#:~:text=Social%20media%20improves%20project%20management,essential%20files%2C%20and%20progress%20reports.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Fool: Does Social Media Have a Role in Project Management?\">social media</a> enhances project management by connecting all the team members and making it easier for them to talk and discuss. Also, social media helps in project management by promoting the project through social marketing campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is one of the most important marketing tools in today's world. What began as an innovation in the website has now evolved into accepted practice. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The internet is full of websites offering many services and products. In this time of competition, you must build a reputation and promote your <a href=\"https://www.podia.com/articles/effective-ways-to-display-testimonials\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Podia: 3 effective ways to display testimonials on your website\">personal brand</a>. The best way to do it is to add testimonials to your website.<br />\r\n&nbsp;<br />\r\nOne way to gain testimonies is to ask your client about their experience. It will have two benefits:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>You will have testimonials to add to your webpage.</li>\r\n\t<li>You will get an idea of what you can improve about the website for smooth navigation.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A study conducted by Stanford University states that <a href=\"https://www.business.com/articles/7-website-design-mistakes-that-can-hurt-conversion/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Business.com: Just Say No: 7 Website Design Mistakes That Can Hurt Conversion\">75% of the customers</a> judge your credibility by your web design. Web design is a crucial factor in knowing whether the business is trustworthy or not.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the reason why your website should be professional and easy to use.

From gathering the ideas from every new and old mind of the company to deciding how to implement the specified idea.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is a fairly recent development, but there is no doubt that innovation software has helped enterprise-level businesses in the evaluation of new ideas.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>With the rise in popularity of social sharing platforms and cloud computing, innovation management software is helping businesses to a whole new level. You can also get the advantage of using it to put your top ideas in place. An excellent way to start is by seeing the pattern of what your customers look for in the first place.</p>\n\n<p>Then, use this information to develop your approach. It will help you to pinpoint the areas your users interact with the most. A well-thought-out plan for how you want your website to appear will put you in the right direction.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>2. Well-Organized Navigation</h2>\n\n<p>Navigation is essential when creating a website. It's a map that illustrates the main locations that customers can visit. You can get this data by utilizing innovative software integrated with your website. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It's a fact that <a href=\"https://jisajournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13174-014-0008-y\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Journal of Internet Services and Applications: A survey on predicting the popularity of web content\">50% of internet users</a> don't know how to use the standard menu. With the right ways, you can lower the percentage, and your customers will be able to find what they are looking for. One of the best ways of doing this is to improve the navigation of your webpage.</p>\n\n<p>Organised navigation will communicate to the client that you want them to have a good time here. This eventually will raise the number of people visiting your website on an average basis.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>3. Visual Organization</h2>\n\n<p>A visual hierarchy determines which component needs to stand out visually on your website. These critical elements should be prioritised. When developing a website, it is vital to use the proper color palette and aesthetic features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Your website's layout and design can increase its impact. Depending on your priorities, you can use <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/website/page-layout-design\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hubspot: The Basics of Page Layout Design (+25 Page Layout Design Ideas)\">various different layouts</a>, such as the N or Z pattern.</p>\n\n<p>You should be clear about how you want your website to look and be willing to think outside the box to make necessary changes.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>4. Excellent Readability</h2>\n\n<p>Website readability assesses how effortless it is for viewers to comprehend the text on a website fully. Your website should be easy to read. Visitors often leave the website within the <a href=\"https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/chartbeat-website-engagement-data-nj\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Hubspot: What Is the Average Time Spent On a Website? [+ How to Improve It]\">first 10-20 seconds</a> if the readability is not good. You must ensure the text does not blend in with the background color.</p>\n\n<p>It is best to have a website with a rank between 60-90. This equates to a grade level between 6th and 8th grades. Aside from aesthetics and structure, the speech of the text is important. It should be straightforward, simple, and spelled correctly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Hard and complex words or sentences will confuse your consumers. It is better to go for a simple language that everyone can understand.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>5. Make Pricing Accessible</h2>\n\n<p>Imagine a scenario where you've arrived at a website looking for idea management tools or software and decided which one is ideal for you. The last step is to consider the cost. But what if I tell you that all the information about the premium plans is hidden and not accessible?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You have to communicate to get all the details. Are you not going to be frustrated by now? Do not go down that path; you are here to help your customers, not to make things difficult for them. Always make sure that pricing information is transparent and easily accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>6. Optimization for Mobile Devices</h2>\n\n<p>Mobile phones alone account for more than <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/277125/share-of-website-traffic-coming-from-mobile-devices/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Statista: Percentage of mobile device website traffic worldwide from 1st quarter 2015 to 2nd quarter 2022\">51 percent of global website visitors</a>. Most people on the internet use mobile phones for browsing. &nbsp;As a result, you can access any webpage you want at any time and from anywhere. When developing a website, consider the comfort of mobile phone users. Many websites are not well optimized for use on mobile devices.</p>\n\n<p>The internet is full of tools that help optimize your website and offer quality advice. Google offers tools to get to know your website response time and help you easily access it on mobile devices&nbsp;and that could potentially increase the <a href=\"https://betterstack.com/community/comparisons/incident-management-tools/\" rel=\" noopener\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Better Stack: 5 Most Used Incident Management Tools (Reviewed &amp; Ranked)\">amount of incidents</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>7.&nbsp;Remove All Distractions</h2>\n\n<p>Certain aspects of your website will draw attention away from the benefit and message you're striving to convey. <a href=\"https://time.com/3858309/attention-spans-goldfish/#:~:text=The%20average%20attention%20span,digitalized%20lifestyle%20on%20the%20brain.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Time.com: You Now Have a Shorter Attention Span Than a Goldfish\">A study by Microsoft Corp</a> claims that humans can focus for only eight seconds, so it is best to use this to your advantage.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>You should know what the client will look for on the website and construct a layout that helps them. You should not distract them from their main purpose of visiting. After all, if you help them, they will return for more.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nIt is also critical to avoid using too many on-page visuals or interplay. It is confusing to navigate through a page and see many buttons flickering. Adding too many icons and symbols will decrease the quality of your webpage. You need to draw attention to important things for you and your client. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>8. Utilize Social Proof</h2>\n\n<p>There is no doubt that <a href=\"https://www.fool.com/the-ascent/small-business/project-management/articles/social-media-project-management/#:~:text=Social%20media%20improves%20project%20management,essential%20files%2C%20and%20progress%20reports.\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Fool: Does Social Media Have a Role in Project Management?\">social media</a> enhances project management by connecting all the team members and making it easier for them to talk and discuss. Also, social media helps in project management by promoting the project through social marketing campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>It is one of the most important marketing tools in today's world. What began as an innovation in the website has now evolved into accepted practice. &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The internet is full of websites offering many services and products. In this time of competition, you must build a reputation and promote your <a href=\"https://www.podia.com/articles/effective-ways-to-display-testimonials\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Podia: 3 effective ways to display testimonials on your website\">personal brand</a>. The best way to do it is to add testimonials to your website.<br />\n&nbsp;<br />\nOne way to gain testimonies is to ask your client about their experience. It will have two benefits:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>You will have testimonials to add to your webpage.</li>\n\t<li>You will get an idea of what you can improve about the website for smooth navigation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>A study conducted by Stanford University states that <a href=\"https://www.business.com/articles/7-website-design-mistakes-that-can-hurt-conversion/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Business.com: Just Say No: 7 Website Design Mistakes That Can Hurt Conversion\">75% of the customers</a> judge your credibility by your web design. Web design is a crucial factor in knowing whether the business is trustworthy or not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>This is the reason why your website should be professional and easy to use. Making an effort to imply these tips will improve the effectiveness and client conversion rate.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<hr />\n<h2>Author bio</h2>\n\n<p>Daniel Martin has hands-on experience in digital marketing since 2007.

          "value": "<p>There are two simultaneous trends dominating in the digital industry today:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>The fast pace of innovation which is dictating the state of the market;</li>\r\n\t<li>And an emphasis on employee-focused company culture and values.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>If we take both into account, a sure-fire recipe for success is cultivating a healthy company culture which promotes and prioritizes innovation. In this article, we’d like to take you through the essential elements and considerations of such a company culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Psychological safety</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Psychological safety (which is defined as “<a href=\"/blog/how-can-agencies-grow-their-digital-business\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How can agencies grow their digital business\">feeling at ease with the people you work with</a>” to the point where you’re comfortable enough to exchange&nbsp;ideas) is crucial for healthy collaboration, especially for diverse cross-departmental teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, a number of your employees may be more reserved about speaking up in psychologically unsafe environments and situations, which would make them hesitant about sharing their ideas and potentially lead to invaluable input missing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Well defined mission, vision and values</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides psychological safety, an essential element of an innovation-focused culture for employees is the sense of purpose, which is derived from a well-defined mission, vision and core values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a sense of purpose will motivate employees to be more driven and innovative, especially if they align strongly with the cause they’re contributing to and/or with your company’s values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>De-siloing</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can’t expect your company to be able to innovate if your teams and/or departments are completely disconnected from each other and work with siloed data and processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>True modern-day innovation requires having a finger on the pulse of the multifaceted aspects of the digital world. In order for this innovation to bear fruit, it’s essential that these different aspects – and hence the departments responsible for each respective one – work well together, which is by default prevented when they’re siloed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remote and hybrid working may pose additional challenges to <a href=\"/podcast/cyril-coste-growth-mindset-and-de-siloing-effective-digital-transformation\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Cyril Coste - Growth mindset and de-siloing for effective digital transformation\">de-siloing</a>.

          "processed": "<p>There are two simultaneous trends dominating in the digital industry today:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The fast pace of innovation which is dictating the state of the market;</li>\n\t<li>And an emphasis on employee-focused company culture and values.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>If we take both into account, a sure-fire recipe for success is cultivating a healthy company culture which promotes and prioritizes innovation. In this article, we’d like to take you through the essential elements and considerations of such a company culture.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Psychological safety</h2>\n\n<p>Psychological safety (which is defined as “<a href=\"/blog/how-can-agencies-grow-their-digital-business\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How can agencies grow their digital business\">feeling at ease with the people you work with</a>” to the point where you’re comfortable enough to exchange&nbsp;ideas) is crucial for healthy collaboration, especially for diverse cross-departmental teams.</p>\n\n<p>In fact, a number of your employees may be more reserved about speaking up in psychologically unsafe environments and situations, which would make them hesitant about sharing their ideas and potentially lead to invaluable input missing.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Well defined mission, vision and values</h2>\n\n<p>Besides psychological safety, an essential element of an innovation-focused culture for employees is the sense of purpose, which is derived from a well-defined mission, vision and core values.</p>\n\n<p>Having a sense of purpose will motivate employees to be more driven and innovative, especially if they align strongly with the cause they’re contributing to and/or with your company’s values.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>De-siloing</h2>\n\n<p>You can’t expect your company to be able to innovate if your teams and/or departments are completely disconnected from each other and work with siloed data and processes.</p>\n\n<p>True modern-day innovation requires having a finger on the pulse of the multifaceted aspects of the digital world. In order for this innovation to bear fruit, it’s essential that these different aspects – and hence the departments responsible for each respective one – work well together, which is by default prevented when they’re siloed.</p>\n\n<p>Remote and hybrid working may pose additional challenges to <a href=\"/podcast/cyril-coste-growth-mindset-and-de-siloing-effective-digital-transformation\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Cyril Coste - Growth mindset and de-siloing for effective digital transformation\">de-siloing</a>.

Let’s get started.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Choose the right partnership model</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The first and foremost consideration should be <a href=\"/blog/keeping-control-your-project-when-outsourcing-software-development\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Keeping control of your project when outsourcing software development\">what kind of partnership model best fits your needs</a>; perhaps you need full support from an agency partner in a specific area, and you thus need them to take care of every aspect of the project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Maybe you need <a href=\"/dedicated-development-teams\" title=\"Agiledrop: Services: Dedicated teams\">a full team to then integrate into your existing processes</a>; or you may just need one or two additional people due to bigger than expected scope.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Choosing the wrong model is more likely to lead to an unsuccessful and unsatisfactory partnership – or to an altogether aversion to outsourcing, which might prove a detriment in future digital initiatives and/or strategic partnerships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Look for reliable technical expertise</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you’ve decided on the right outsourcing model for your business, the next step is to <a href=\"/blog/how-find-right-digital-agency\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How to find the right digital agency\">find the right agency to partner with</a>, where you’ll primarily need to determine whether they have adequate technical expertise to help you realize your project or digital initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best resources here will be the agency’s <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/node/1970744/case-studies\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Agiledrop case studies\">case studies</a> and <a href=\"/references\" title=\"Agiledrop references\">references</a>, as well as any other content that showcases their expertise in the areas you’re looking for.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conduct a thorough discovery phase to get on the same page&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A thorough discovery process will be essential to getting your new partner aligned with your company’s mission and vision, without which they will have a hard time providing the best possible services for you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bring the new partner up to speed on the most important past considerations for the project and any existing work done on it, and have them also actively participate in the process by asking questions and/or presenting their own ideas for solutions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Needless to say, make sure you thoroughly communicate the project specs and requirements – its key features, goals and KPIs, plus any other important considerations, such as specific audience characteristics, milestones and deadlines, or any new or particular regulatory requirements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Integrate external team members into your teams &amp; processes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>You can’t expect your outsourced teammates to work well with your in-house teams and processes if you treat them like outsiders. The people ultimately working on your project will not be the same ones participating in discovery, so you’ll need to familiarize them with your culture and values to ensure optimal collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, if you’ve opted for a managed services type of partnership, you’ll want an external team that’s pretty much self managed, but in all other outsourcing models, not incorporating the new teams into your existing structures is likely to have a detrimental effect on the project(s) and/or the quality of the partnership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Have good, regular communication with the partner agency</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A while back, we wrote an article about <a href=\"/blog/most-important-thing-agency-partnership\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: The most important thing in an agency partnership\">the most important thing in an agency partnership</a> – <strong>communication</strong>; and&nbsp;of course it&nbsp;still holds true today, perhaps even more so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Good communication forms the basis of any good relationship, be it a personal or a business one, with the latter having higher stakes due to the complexity of decision making and other factors such as brand reputation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure to have well established communication channels between you and your partner agency, and get involved throughout the project rather than demand drastic changes at the very end stages. Transparency and a good feedback loop will be vital to a successful collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Establish longer-term partnerships</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A relationship will be much more fruitful if there is mutual commitment from all sides. The longer a partnership lasts, the more attuned your partner agency can become with your culture and hence more committed to satisfying your needs in the best way&nbsp;possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Trust is key to a strong relationship, and building a strong foundation of trust typically requires some time – which doesn’t mean you can’t collaborate effectively right from the start, just that the collaboration will only improve and the value of the partnership will grow as time passes and trust is reinforced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What’s more, you will waste time and&nbsp;resources if you look for a new partner every single time you need external support. It’s better to forge strong long-term partnerships and have someone you know you can rely on, even if you don’t need their services 100% of the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope this article will help you get the most out of your agency partnerships.

Here are our top picks from June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal 9.4.0 is available</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>First up, we have the announcement by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/gaborhojtsy\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Gábor Hojtsy Twitter\">Gábor Hojtsy</a> of what’s new in the latest minor Drupal version, 9.4.0. The two most important changes are the inclusion of Olivero as the default front-end theme and Claro as the default back-end theme.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other updates include the new experimental Starterkit theme and theme generator, lazy loading config options for image fields, easier permission management and drupal/core-recommended optimizations for managing security updates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As is tradition, Gábor also includes a section on what this minor release means for site owners still on previous versions, as well as for people contributing modules, themes and translations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/blog/drupal-9-4-0\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Drupal 9.4.0 is available\"><strong>Read more about what’s new in Drupal 9.4.0</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Meet Bookish, an install profile for static Drupal blogs</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The next post from June comes from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mortensonsam\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sam Mortenson Twitter\">Samuel Mortenson</a>, the creator of <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/project/tome\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Tome\">Tome</a>, the static site generation module for Drupal. He presents a new Drupal install profile for static blogs, called Bookish, which is similar to Tome but with streamlined out-of-the-box features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In his post, Samuel gives a detailed breakdown of the features of Bookish, with some of the most interesting ones being the use of Single File Components for the theme, an image blur-up effect, an image widget for cropping and editing colors, and the inclusion of CKEditor 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://mortenson.coffee/blog/meet-bookish-install-profile-static-drupal-blogs/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Sam Mortenson: Meet Bookish, an install profile for static Drupal blogs\"><strong>Read more about Bookish</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Why Drupal is a Shark</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the third post, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dominiquedc\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dominique De Cooman Twitter\">Dominique De Cooman</a> of <a href=\"https://dropsolid.com/en/choice\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dropsolid homepage\">Dropsolid</a> argues that Drupal is more like a shark rather than a dinosaur, since it has been able to adapt to all the transformations the web has undergone in the past 20 years and come out as a winning technology choice today.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key reason for Drupal’s continued success is the move from a website to a digital experience platform. Drupal is able to thrive here as the top open-source solution for enterprise cases thanks to its commitment to the MACH architecture: microservices, API-first, cloud-native and headless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dropsolid.com/en/knowledge-hub/why-drupal-shark\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dropsolid: Why Drupal is a Shark\"><strong>Read more about what makes Drupal a shark</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Pitfalls (and fixes) when lazy-loading images in Drupal</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have a post by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikeherchel\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mike Herchel Twitter\">Mike Herchel</a> exploring the peculiarities of default lazy loading of images introduced in Drupal 9.1. An essential tool here is the new UI for customizing image loading which came in Drupal 9.4.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Mike points out, the key consideration for lazy loading is whether or not a specific image is displayed above the fold, which developers should keep top of mind when planning the content architecture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those wanting additional control, it’s possible to set the correct loading attribute when preprocessing the image field, as well as directly in the Twig template and/or in Views.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://herchel.com/articles/pitfalls-and-fixes-when-lazy-loading-images-drupal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Herchel.com: Pitfalls (and fixes) when lazy-loading images in Drupal\"><strong>Read more about lazy loading in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal 9: Different Update Hooks And When To Use Them</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Another prolific author has recently been <a href=\"https://twitter.com/philipnorton42\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Philip Norton Twitter\">Philip Norton</a> on his blog <a href=\"https://www.hashbangcode.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#! Code homepage\">#! Code</a>, producing weekly guides for different elements of Drupal 9. The one we’re including this time around is focused on Drupal update hooks, which have a wide range of use cases, including smoothly deploying more complex content changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the article, Philip takes a detailed look at <code>hook_update_N()</code>, <code>hook_post_update_NAME()</code> and the new <code>hook_deploy_NAME()</code>, along with tips and considerations for when (not) to use each one. He finishes with a few additional tips and his own experiences with using hooks, as well as the Drush documentation table on their usage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.hashbangcode.com/article/drupal-9-different-update-hooks-and-when-use-them\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"#!

He writes about enabling component libraries in Drupal via the suite of component library modules developed by Lullabot, which aim for compatibility between Twig, JavaScript and SCSS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Up until now, the go-to solution has been to use Twig.js, which has a lot of limitations. Instead of the effort of emulating Drupal in component libraries, Mateu recommends having Drupal render the components on the server.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This allows the usage of Storybook as the component library, giving the best of both worlds: components that are aligned with Drupal themes and modern development techniques.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.lullabot.com/articles/component-libraries-drupal\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lullabot: Component Libraries in Drupal\"><strong>Read more about component libraries in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>The right way to check for empty content in Twig</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We continue with one more post that’s related to Twig, this one written by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mohit_rocks\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Mohit Aghera Twitter\">Mohit Aghera</a> of <a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext homepage\">PreviousNext</a>, who presents the right way for checking for empty content before rendering in Twig.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The problem that arose with the traditional Twig method was Webform submissions being recorded twice, and the second render invalidated the token generated by the Webform handler.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily, there is a pretty straightforward solution: using the set tag in Twig, either in combination with a spaceless filter or alone in a set statement, which ensures that the content only gets rendered one time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/right-way-check-empty-content-twig\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext: The right way to check for empty content in Twig\"><strong>Read more about checking for empty content in Twig</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Strategic Initiatives Now Have Logos!</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The final post from June is more community-oriented, with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/therealshefali\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Shefali Shetty Twitter\">Shefali Shetty</a> presenting the newly designed logos for each of Drupal’s strategic initiatives and giving some background on their creation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A key goal of these new logos is making projects more memorable and impressionable, both within the Drupal community as well as for outsiders, as they will also be invaluable elements of future marketing materials.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The creation of the logos also showcases true Drupal collaboration: the Promote Drupal team worked with initiative leads to get a better feel for the goals behind each initiative, then collaborated with the designer Vinicius Custudio to transform them into logos.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/strategic-initiatives-now-have-logos\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Strategic Initiatives Now Have Logos!\"><strong>Read more about strategic initiatives logos</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"1d32ef6a-60fe-4370-b022-c6da7e727d06\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p><em>That’s all for last month's&nbsp;Drupal articles.

          "value": "<p>One of our core values at Agiledrop is learning and sharing knowledge. Different educational activities have always been an essential element of our company culture, geared towards both our employees as well as the local development community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ve recently taken our commitment to learning to the next level with the introduction of new employee-focused processes and activities, and the expansion of our free technology courses for aspiring local developers. In this article, we’d like to tell you more about these.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Internal learning</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s first go through our internal educational and learning elements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Onboarding &amp; mentorship</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ever since Agiledrop’s inception, we’ve been keenly aware of the value of a good onboarding experience facilitated by a dedicated mentor. This became even more important during Covid lockdowns, when we had to <a href=\"/blog/employee-experience-agiledrop-8-lessons-learned-2020\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Employee Experience at Agiledrop - 8 lessons learned from 2020\">streamline our onboarding process</a> to accommodate employees joining the team remotely during that time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On top of that, we recently introduced the role of a dedicated front-end mentor in addition to just a back-end / general development mentor, which not only enables &nbsp;front-end mentorship to be on a higher level due to more specialized expertise, but also frees up the time and focus of the back-end mentors, allowing them to commit more to their mentees – so, it’s a win-win for both front-end and back-end developers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Help between teammates</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>But it’s not exclusively the mentors who help out junior and mid-level developers. Help between teammates is baked right into our strong culture of collaboration, and we both encourage and reward it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a dedicated Slack channel where team members can ask for and receive help, and we’ve recently introduced the AgileKarma bot to our Slack, which allows teammates to give points to each other for their help and thus promotes cooperation in a healthy, constructive way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Dashboard with Skills Review</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020, when we were mostly working from home, we developed an in-house Dashboard app which allows employees to easily accomplish things such as track time or request a vacation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In December, we added the Skills Review feature to the app, which not only provides developers and their managers with a better overview of the developer’s experience, but also gives them the ability to assess how interested they are in a particular skill and if they would like more dedicated learning opportunities in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Specific video courses and tutorials</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to streamlined onboarding and skills reviewing, we also provide employees with a selection of video tutorials to hone specific skills, also accessible from the Dashboard app.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There’s a wide range of different technology courses available here: Drupal-related resources such as Drupalize.me and the Acquia Certification; two Laravel resources, Laracasts and Laravel Daily; and a number of JavaScript / front-end tutorials, e.g. Angular University and different Udemy courses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>AgileTalks &amp; recently introduced AgileWorkshops</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of our mainstay team activities have always been AgileTalks – short-form, 30 minute-ish presentations providing an overview of a particular topic, which tends to be something development-related, but can also be more general such as <a href=\"/blog/how-improve-your-time-management-skills-and-master-your-time\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: How to improve your time management skills and master your time\">time management</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2021, we introduced an add-on to AgileTalks – AgileWorkshops, which last longer and expand the topic discussed on AgileTalks with a more practical programme focused on technical details. We had 3 Workshops last year: two were about VueJS and one was dedicated to debugging Drupal and PHP in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>AgileAcademy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.agiledrop.com/blog/2021-review\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: 2021 in review\">Both AgileTalks and Workshops fall under another new initiative:</a> AgileAcademy, which also includes external learning activities, about which you’ll learn more in the second half of this post.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>External learning</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Now let’s break down our external learning activities which are geared towards the local development community.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Drupal&nbsp;workshops</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>We held our first free Drupal workshop back in 2017 and have kept up the tradition ever since, even managing to run a few courses during the Covid era when lockdowns were eased. These are one-day workshops taking place on a Saturday, during which we go through the basics of creating a Drupal website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Getting new developers familiar with an open-source technology is one of the best ways to give back to the project and its community, with the additional value of also contributing to the local development community by helping up-and-coming developers get a foot in the door.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"40d1093d-d306-4000-a07b-1f411d2d0686\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>PHP Masterclass</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like we streamlined the internal AgileTalks with more practical workshops, we expanded the beginner-oriented Drupal workshops with the addition of a PHP Masterclass, an in-depth course on PHP taking place over two weeks where participants were required to already have some skills with PHP programming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Hosting meetups</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2019, we started working more frequently with technologies beyond Drupal and so we also started getting more involved in their respective communities. We hosted our first PHP meetup in June 2019, where we also had the privilege of <a href=\"/blog/interview-peter-kokot-one-release-managers-php-74\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Interview with Peter Kokot, one of the release managers of PHP 7.4\">learning more about the then upcoming PHP 7.4 from one of its release managers</a> who was an Agiledrop team member at the time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second PHP meetup took place in September 2019, then we hosted our first WordPress meetup in February 2020 just before the pandemic began. For obvious reasons, we only hosted a single PHP meetup during Covid, but now we’re back on track and already gearing up for more upcoming internal and external events.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Featured as a speaker</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>A few times, our development director Boštjan and other team members have presented sessions at events in which we participated, such as a Drupal course we hosted at a local school center and most recently as part of the DragonHack hackathon organized by Major League Hacking.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"6c2d573f-d5c8-42bc-a602-20b8addefb5e\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>New masterclasses &amp; other courses coming soon as part of AgileAcademy</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>The Agile Academy is an attempt at connecting our internal and external learning activities, setting higher standards and facilitating organization for both.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first external Agile Academy event was the already mentioned PHP Masterclass – which was a major success – but there are definitely new ones coming soon, as well as a new platform based on the <a href=\"/podcast/taco-potze-open-social-open-source-online-community-platform\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Taco Potze - Open Social, the open-source online community platform\">Open Social</a> Drupal distribution which will optimize the experience of applicants and participants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A true commitment to promoting and facilitating learning has an incredibly positive impact on the employee experience as well as on the overall perception of your brand.

In the post, she recalls some of her favorite memories and key milestones from her contribution journey and thanks everyone who mentored her along the way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>She continues by expressing her gratitude and appreciation for the entire Drupal community who makes Drupal what it is today.

He also includes a five-step of how all of these put together could function for a small-scale Drupal website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://read.theodoreb.net/2022/can-drupal-scale-down.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Théodore Biadala: Can Drupal scale down?\"><strong>Read more about scaling down Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Overriding base field labels and descriptions of Drupal Entities without custom code</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In the next post from May, <a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext homepage\">PreviousNext</a>’s senior developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/larowlan\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lee Rowlands Twitter\">Lee Rowlands</a> shows how you can override base field labels and descriptions of Drupal entities without needing to use any custom code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This can be done with the Base Field Override UI module, but this covers a limited number of cases, so Lee proposes editing the YML directly. You need to export the desired YML files using Drush, update the relevant core.base_field_override file and import it back again with Drush. This allows you to make small changes without needing a custom module.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/overriding-base-field-labels-and-descriptions-of-drupal-entities-without-custom-code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext: Overriding base field labels and descriptions of Drupal Entities without custom code\"><strong>Read more about overriding field labels and descriptions in Drupal</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Implementing a React App and Connecting it to a Custom Drupal Block to Pull in Remote API Data</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Next up, we have a post from <a href=\"https://www.dannyenglander.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Danny Englander homepage\">Danny Englander</a> who shows how to use a progressively decoupled approach to create a custom Drupal block displaying a React application which pulls data from a remote API using the Axios library.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He describes this step by step, first creating the custom React app pulling data from the USA Jobs API, then the custom Drupal module that will contain the app and the custom block, and finally updating the Twig template to allow the React app to render the data right within the Drupal block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dannyenglander.com/blog/implementing-a-react-app-connecting-to-custom-drupal-block-to-pull-remote-api-data/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Danny Englander: Implementing a React App and Connecting it to a Custom Drupal Block to Pull in Remote API Data\"><strong>Read more about progressively decoupling Drupal with React</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>GAAD Pledge 2022 - Extending Drupal' Accessibility</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Moving on, we have the pledge to extend Drupal’s accessibility on the 2022 Global Accessibility Awareness Day, announced by the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Drupal Association \">Drupal Association</a> on behalf of the Drupal accessibility maintainers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While always having been very committed to accessibility, Drupal now joins existing GAAD Pledgees React Native and Ember.js as a leading open-source community promoting accessibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The post also includes a brief history of Drupal’s commitment to accessibility, going back to Drupal 7 in 2011, as well as the 5 elements of the 2022 GAAD pledge, before concluding with tips on how community members can help out with this initiative.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/gaad-pledge-2022-extending-drupals-accessibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: GAAD Pledge 2022 - Extending Drupal's Accessibility\"><strong>Read more about Drupal’s 2022 GAAD Pledge</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Introducing the Schema.org Blueprints Module for Ambitious Drupal Site Builders</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Whenever there is a recent article coming from <a href=\"https://www.jrockowitz.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jrockowitz homepage\">Jacob Rockowitz</a>, the creator and maintainer of the Webform module, it’s essentially impossible not to feature it in our monthly recap.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This time he wrote about the Schema.org Blueprints module, which also fits the use case of an “ambitious site builder” that Dries introduced during his DrupalCon keynote, and is likewise built on the principles of standardization, simplification, and acceleration of the website building process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jacob includes a short video overview of the module, as well as a full demo presentation. The discussion in the comments under the article is also very interesting, so be sure to check that out as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/schemadotorg-blueprints\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jrockowitz: Introducing the Schema.org Blueprints Module for Ambitious Drupal Site Builders\"><strong>Read more about the Schema.org Blueprints module</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>A plan for Drupal 11</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Let’s conclude May’s selection with another post from Dries, this one outlining the strategy for Drupal 11 as the final part of his Driesnote recap. In addition to empowering ambitious site builders, the Drupal 11 strategy will focus on accelerating innovation in the contributed modules repository.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout the post, he breaks down the main initiatives for Drupal 11 readiness: having Project Browser, Automated Updates and Starter Templates stable in core, with the last one also available through drupal.org; streamlining the GitLab initiative; and making Drupal Core smaller by moving functionality to contributed modules, which he calls “the Great Module Migration”.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://dri.es/a-plan-for-drupal-11\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries: A plan for Drupal 11\"><strong>Read more about the plan for Drupal 11</strong></a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"2e5a3103-f626-4027-b9db-6939d4e4dbbc\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This concludes our overview of May’s top Drupal articles.

He also includes a five-step of how all of these put together could function for a small-scale Drupal website.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://read.theodoreb.net/2022/can-drupal-scale-down.html\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Théodore Biadala: Can Drupal scale down?\"><strong>Read more about scaling down Drupal</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Overriding base field labels and descriptions of Drupal Entities without custom code</h3>\n\n<p>In the next post from May, <a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext homepage\">PreviousNext</a>’s senior developer <a href=\"https://twitter.com/larowlan\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Lee Rowlands Twitter\">Lee Rowlands</a> shows how you can override base field labels and descriptions of Drupal entities without needing to use any custom code.</p>\n\n<p>This can be done with the Base Field Override UI module, but this covers a limited number of cases, so Lee proposes editing the YML directly. You need to export the desired YML files using Drush, update the relevant core.base_field_override file and import it back again with Drush. This allows you to make small changes without needing a custom module.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.previousnext.com.au/blog/overriding-base-field-labels-and-descriptions-of-drupal-entities-without-custom-code\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"PreviousNext: Overriding base field labels and descriptions of Drupal Entities without custom code\"><strong>Read more about overriding field labels and descriptions in Drupal</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Implementing a React App and Connecting it to a Custom Drupal Block to Pull in Remote API Data</h3>\n\n<p>Next up, we have a post from <a href=\"https://www.dannyenglander.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Danny Englander homepage\">Danny Englander</a> who shows how to use a progressively decoupled approach to create a custom Drupal block displaying a React application which pulls data from a remote API using the Axios library.</p>\n\n<p>He describes this step by step, first creating the custom React app pulling data from the USA Jobs API, then the custom Drupal module that will contain the app and the custom block, and finally updating the Twig template to allow the React app to render the data right within the Drupal block.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.dannyenglander.com/blog/implementing-a-react-app-connecting-to-custom-drupal-block-to-pull-remote-api-data/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Danny Englander: Implementing a React App and Connecting it to a Custom Drupal Block to Pull in Remote API Data\"><strong>Read more about progressively decoupling Drupal with React</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>GAAD Pledge 2022 - Extending Drupal' Accessibility</h3>\n\n<p>Moving on, we have the pledge to extend Drupal’s accessibility on the 2022 Global Accessibility Awareness Day, announced by the <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Drupal Association \">Drupal Association</a> on behalf of the Drupal accessibility maintainers.</p>\n\n<p>While always having been very committed to accessibility, Drupal now joins existing GAAD Pledgees React Native and Ember.js as a leading open-source community promoting accessibility.</p>\n\n<p>The post also includes a brief history of Drupal’s commitment to accessibility, going back to Drupal 7 in 2011, as well as the 5 elements of the 2022 GAAD pledge, before concluding with tips on how community members can help out with this initiative. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/association/blog/gaad-pledge-2022-extending-drupals-accessibility\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: GAAD Pledge 2022 - Extending Drupal's Accessibility\"><strong>Read more about Drupal’s 2022 GAAD Pledge</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>Introducing the Schema.org Blueprints Module for Ambitious Drupal Site Builders</h3>\n\n<p>Whenever there is a recent article coming from <a href=\"https://www.jrockowitz.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jrockowitz homepage\">Jacob Rockowitz</a>, the creator and maintainer of the Webform module, it’s essentially impossible not to feature it in our monthly recap.</p>\n\n<p>This time he wrote about the Schema.org Blueprints module, which also fits the use case of an “ambitious site builder” that Dries introduced during his DrupalCon keynote, and is likewise built on the principles of standardization, simplification, and acceleration of the website building process.</p>\n\n<p>Jacob includes a short video overview of the module, as well as a full demo presentation. The discussion in the comments under the article is also very interesting, so be sure to check that out as well.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jrockowitz.com/blog/schemadotorg-blueprints\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jrockowitz: Introducing the Schema.org Blueprints Module for Ambitious Drupal Site Builders\"><strong>Read more about the Schema.org Blueprints module</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h3>A plan for Drupal 11</h3>\n\n<p>Let’s conclude May’s selection with another post from Dries, this one outlining the strategy for Drupal 11 as the final part of his Driesnote recap. In addition to empowering ambitious site builders, the Drupal 11 strategy will focus on accelerating innovation in the contributed modules repository.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the post, he breaks down the main initiatives for Drupal 11 readiness: having Project Browser, Automated Updates and Starter Templates stable in core, with the last one also available through drupal.org; streamlining the GitLab initiative; and making Drupal Core smaller by moving functionality to contributed modules, which he calls “the Great Module Migration”.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://dri.es/a-plan-for-drupal-11\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries: A plan for Drupal 11\"><strong>Read more about the plan for Drupal 11</strong></a></p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<article data-align=\"center\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/medium_800/public/2022-06/Top%20Drupal%20BP%20May%20final.png?itok=XIARHBAL\" width=\"800\" height=\"400\" alt=\"Plan sketched out with differently colored chalk\" loading=\"lazy\" /></article><p><em>This concludes our overview of May’s top Drupal articles.

In <a href=\"/blog/consistency-multichannel-digital-experiences-part-1-benefits-best-practices\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Consistency in multichannel digital experiences – Part 1: Benefits &amp; best practices\">part one</a>, we dealt with benefits and best practices of consistency, and in <a href=\"/blog/consistency-multichannel-digital-experiences-part-2-technology-considerations\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Consistency in multichannel digital experiences – Part 2: Technology considerations\">part two</a>, we broke down the most basic technology considerations for creating consistent experiences. The third and final part will explore what to keep in mind when implementing a consistent multichannel strategy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Your&nbsp;audience’s&nbsp;habits</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>An essential consideration in designing consistent experiences should be your target audience’s habits. Good data management and a dedicated, human approach to design are the most important requirements here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t forget to stay on top of societal and technological trends to be in the know about how these habits are changing. Additionally, due to recent and upcoming privacy regulations, try to learn as much about your audience as possible through <strong>first-party data</strong>, so you have a sustainable strategy for <a href=\"/podcast/alex-trup-importance-customer-first-digital-marketing\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Alex Trup - The importance of customer-first digital marketing\">when 3rd-party cookies roll out</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Future&nbsp;readiness</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the key considerations should also be securing consistency not just in the current experience, but also in the long term. Find and implement the right <a href=\"/blog/future-ready-means-disruption-ready\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Future-ready means disruption-ready\">future-ready</a> workflows that best suit your company, and opt for future-proof technology platforms to execute on your multichannel strategy so that you’re able to stay nimble and adapt quickly to emerging trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Your&nbsp;tech&nbsp;stack&nbsp;/&nbsp;legacy&nbsp;infrastructure</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A major factor in how easy it is to create and manage multichannel experiences is your <a href=\"/blog/importance-right-technology-stack-digital-strategy\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: The importance of the right technology stack in a digital strategy\">technology stack</a>.

In <a href=\"/blog/consistency-multichannel-digital-experiences-part-1-benefits-best-practices\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Consistency in multichannel digital experiences – Part 1: Benefits &amp; best practices\">part one</a>, we dealt with benefits and best practices of consistency, and in <a href=\"/blog/consistency-multichannel-digital-experiences-part-2-technology-considerations\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Consistency in multichannel digital experiences – Part 2: Technology considerations\">part two</a>, we broke down the most basic technology considerations for creating consistent experiences. The third and final part will explore what to keep in mind when implementing a consistent multichannel strategy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Your&nbsp;audience’s&nbsp;habits</h2>\n\n<p>An essential consideration in designing consistent experiences should be your target audience’s habits. Good data management and a dedicated, human approach to design are the most important requirements here.</p>\n\n<p>Don’t forget to stay on top of societal and technological trends to be in the know about how these habits are changing. Additionally, due to recent and upcoming privacy regulations, try to learn as much about your audience as possible through <strong>first-party data</strong>, so you have a sustainable strategy for <a href=\"/podcast/alex-trup-importance-customer-first-digital-marketing\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Alex Trup - The importance of customer-first digital marketing\">when 3rd-party cookies roll out</a>.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Future&nbsp;readiness</h2>\n\n<p>One of the key considerations should also be securing consistency not just in the current experience, but also in the long term. Find and implement the right <a href=\"/blog/future-ready-means-disruption-ready\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Future-ready means disruption-ready\">future-ready</a> workflows that best suit your company, and opt for future-proof technology platforms to execute on your multichannel strategy so that you’re able to stay nimble and adapt quickly to emerging trends.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Your&nbsp;tech&nbsp;stack&nbsp;/&nbsp;legacy&nbsp;infrastructure</h2>\n\n<p>A major factor in how easy it is to create and manage multichannel experiences is your <a href=\"/blog/importance-right-technology-stack-digital-strategy\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: The importance of the right technology stack in a digital strategy\">technology stack</a>. Logically, an outdated stack will make this significantly more difficult than a technology infrastructure composed of up-to-date, modern technologies.</p>\n\n<p>While technology platforms have made significant improvements in recent years to cater to the drastic changes in digital experiences, there are still those that are widely used, but aren’t optimized for creating multichannel experiences at scale.</p>\n\n<p>A full implementation of a multichannel / omnichannel strategy might require you to move to a much newer version of the platform, which would be practically the same as moving to a whole new platform.</p>\n\n<p>It might even happen that you’ll realize that such an upgrade is not feasible for your business and it is near impossible to justify the investment – in this case, you might need to do a lot of extra work to maintain consistency, perhaps even develop separate custom solutions each platform you know you’ll need, which will in turn likely produce huge additional costs and technical debt of their own.</p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, the most modern platforms have all streamlined their multichannel capabilities; they’re either built in a way that facilitates that (e.g. a dedicated decoupled CMS), or integrations with any kind of other technology have been streamlined through community efforts and strategic priorities (e.g. <a href=\"https://dri.es/drupal-is-api-first-not-api-only\" rel=\"noopener nofollow \" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Dries Buytaert: Drupal is API-first, not API-only\">Drupal as an API-first CMS</a>).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2>Your&nbsp;IT&nbsp;capabilities</h2>\n\n<p>Closely tied to your legacy stack are your company’s technology capabilities.

In <a href=\"/blog/consistency-multichannel-digital-experiences-part-1-benefits-best-practices\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Consistency in multichannel digital experiences – Part 1: Benefits &amp; best practices\">part one</a>, we focused on the reasons for needing to ensure consistency and highlighted five best practices for creating consistent experiences.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the current article, we’ll continue with considerations for deciding on the best architecture and technologies, and we’ll round things off in part three with a breakdown of what to keep top of mind to ensure customers’ experience remains consistent as they interact with your brand on different channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Design system</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>A design system is one of the most reliable resources for ensuring consistency in digital experiences. It allows you to define design standardizations for different channels, functioning as a kind of library of reusable elements which you can pick and choose from depending on your specific need.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would recommend using a design system alongside other approaches, especially if your brand consists of multiple domains or sub-brands, and thus involves/requires efficient collaboration between several different stakeholders and teams.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Content management system / digital experience platform</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>More often than not, your website and/or your entire digital infrastructure will be powered by a content management system – or, to use a modern but more or less synonymous term – a digital experience platform. There are two main categories here:</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>a) Proprietary CMS / Software as a Service</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Platforms such as Adobe Experience Manager, Optimizely and Salesforce are all significantly streamlined, both for the web and as well as the broader digital ecosystem, and they function perfectly as closed systems with a wide range of capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it gets tricky, though, is when the SaaS platform lacks a specific piece of functionality that’s of vital strategic importance for your brand, and you aren’t able to develop your own solution or comb through the community for potential existing solutions due to the closed-source nature of the code.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Migrating off of a closed system, however, will require a lot of time, effort and resources, and may even result in losing users and/or pieces of content, which is why it poses quite a significant risk in the fast-evolving landscape that we’re in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What this means is that you’ll likely decide to stay on the already chosen platform and forswear the new desired functionality. If you were able to already identify this as a major potential future setback in the platform evaluation process, it’s most likely best to go with a more open platform instead, where you’ll have more flexibility and thus guarantee greater future-readiness.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>b) Open-source CMS / open DXP</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>As opposed to a SaaS solution for managing your digital experiences, an open-source platform will give you greater flexibility and longevity, at the cost of a bigger initial investment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional CMS platforms such as WordPress and <a href=\"/drupal\" title=\"Agiledrop: Drupal development\">Drupal</a> have come a long way since the monolithic web content management and are now optimized to power multichannel experiences on a high level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A middle ground option could be using an open DXP such as the Drupal-based <a href=\"/blog/agiledrop-becomes-acquia-partner\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Agiledrop becomes Acquia partner\">Acquia</a>, which will give you the best of both worlds – quick and pain-free startup without sacrificing customization capabilities in the long run.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>APIs and headless / decoupled setups</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.newtarget.com/web-insights-blog/api/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"New Target blog: What Is an API?\">APIs</a> are the glue that holds together and enables the multiplicity of digital experiences. As just mentioned, traditional content management platforms are now able to power more than just monolithic web experiences through streamlined API initiatives such as <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/docs/core-modules-and-themes/core-modules/jsonapi-module/api-overview\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: JSON:API module - API overview\">Drupal’s JSON:API</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This allows a traditional CMS to be used as a <a href=\"https://www.agiledrop.com/blog/decoupling-drupal-react-vue\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Decoupling Drupal: React &amp; Vue\">decoupled</a> / headless CMS, with the front end separated from the database and as such the perfect fit for consistent multichannel experiences, where a robust database functions as a content repository which is able to serve content to multiple front ends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also opt for a headless-first CMS such as Contentful if you’re already starting out with a need for multiple diverse channels, which sacrifices coupled functionality for more streamlined and efficient decoupled capabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Custom development</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite how streamlined CMS and DX platforms have become, there will come scenarios where you’ll need to make use of custom code, either for a new feature or to compensate for some technical debt and/or infrastructure limitations. Let’s take a look at a few different scenarios of using custom development.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>a) Completely custom-code</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Custom development for the main content platform and each specific channel will almost by necessity be both costly and time-consuming, both of which are a poor fit for the current fast-moving landscape. This is precisely why frameworks and libraries exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hand, developing certain features or pieces of functionality you need for your platform, but then releasing them publicly as open source is one of the best things you can do, especially if you rely heavily on the open-source technology that it’s a part of. Again – this is why frameworks and libraries exist; because of the drive to empower others as much as oneself.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>b) Custom close-source framework(s)</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, creating a full-fledged close-source framework for your business would most likely be overkill – if you’re not Google or Apple, that is. That would require an enormous amount of planning and resources with a meticulous strategy, all of which are unprecedentedly difficult to guarantee in such volatile times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, for the vast majority of companies which are not the likes of Google or Apple, creating an entire custom framework without any intention of releasing it publicly would make zero business sense, especially with the abundance of excellent open-source and proprietary options available.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>c) Custom CMS</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on your specific needs and/or existing technology infrastructure, you may consider building a custom content management system that best suits either scenario rather than any of the options we outlined earlier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What you’ll likely find, though, is that a lot of existing SaaS solutions will be able to satisfy those needs, and the top open-source options are so streamlined and flexible that they easily integrate with any kind of technology stack and enable almost unlimited customization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, unless none of the existing options caters to your specific needs, you should opt for an existing CMS / digital experience platform rather than expend a lot of resources on reinventing the wheel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Wrapping up</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In the second article on consistent multichannel experiences, we looked at the main technology solutions for creating them. Don’t miss the third and final part early next week, in which we’ll conclude the series with a breakdown of the considerations that should guide you along the process of creating and implementing consistent customer experiences.</p>\r\n",

People are increasingly getting used to omnichannel / multichannel experiences<br />\r\n2. People are increasingly prioritizing consistency when interacting with brands</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At first glance, this contradiction appears to entail quite a few problems. How can you ensure your user and customer experience remain consistent across different channels and devices? And, perhaps even more importantly, how can you ensure that this consistency is itself consistent across time as technology trends and practices evolve?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We’ll dive into these questions in this three-part series of articles. In part one, we’ll be taking a detailed look into why you need to provide consistent experiences and&nbsp;what the best practices for creating them are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In <a href=\"/blog/consistency-multichannel-digital-experiences-part-2-technology-considerations\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Consistency in multichannel digital experiences – Part 2: Technology considerations\">part two</a>, we’ll provide an overview of&nbsp;what your main technology considerations should be, and in <a href=\"/blog/consistency-multichannel-digital-experiences-part-3-implementation-considerations\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: Consistency in multichannel digital experiences – Part 3: Implementation considerations\">part three</a>, we’ll explore the key implementation considerations of a consistent multichannel strategy.

This is becoming increasingly important as mobile usage continues to rise and customers increasingly expect instant access, engagement and transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Stronger brand</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Today’s consumers, especially the younger gen Y and Z, place a lot of importance on the brand – what it stands for, how it interacts with their customers, how relevant it is, and how consistent it is. They’re very focused on the experience and can have a huge impact on the reputation of the brand in question.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consistent experiences are able to much more clearly convey the brand image and thus contribute to a stronger, more recognizable and better established brand. In contrast, a brand with inconsistent experiences can be viewed as sloppy, not customer-focused and/or not up to date with trends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Less churn and greater retention &amp; conversion</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Building upon the previous two points, inconsistency leads to more customers deciding to stop doing business with a brand (this is called <em>churn</em> or <em>attrition</em>), while well thought-out, consistent experiences lead to more conversions and greater retention of customers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Empathy&nbsp;establishes and strengthens trust</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, your digital experiences should be customer-centric rather than based exclusively on company goals and KPIs, and having <a href=\"/podcast/ivan-stegic-leading-empathy\" title=\"Agiledrop podcast: Ivan Stegic - Leading with empathy\">empathy for customers</a> is the key to creating experiences that matter to them most.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It means understanding their needs as well as their pain points, then tailoring the multichannel experiences to this understanding, in a holistic way that establishes you as a trustworthy brand across all channels rather than leaving your customers unsure whether or not they can trust you following some inconsistent experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Best practices and&nbsp;practical tips</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>This section will break down 5 best practices and practical tips on how to go about creating consistent experiences across all your key channels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Make sure your departments and/or teams are on the same page</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can’t expect your consumer-facing experiences to be consistent if your internal teams and processes lack alignment.

Please describe your two most memorable contribution experiences; both as a contributor and as a mentor.</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't think I have a single moment for myself that I can point to, but rather the time I spent in the run-up to Drupal 8 helping out with the Migration in Core initiative. I learned **so** much from the other folks on the team – I was fortunate to have the time to devote to that project.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably the most memorable moment is one that is a bit fuzzy on the details, but very clear emotionally – it was at a DrupalCon awhile ago (San Francisco 2010, maybe) during the contribution day – it was the first time I witnessed live core commits by one of the core committers (Angie Byron, I think) and the folks in the room made a really big deal out of it. It was quite inspiring for something that is normally done quietly by someone all by themselves. I specifically recall the energy in the room and folks talking about the excitement of seeing it happen in person.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a mentor, I am lucky enough to have so many great memories. Most of them are related to students that I taught/mentored who eventually find full-time jobs in Drupal, achieving one of the professional goals. It's not easy to beat the feeling of being part of their journey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Why is it so valuable that we contribute to open source and to Drupal in particular?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There's the altruistic answer to this question – because it's the right thing to do, it elevates all of us, it's a way of showing support for the software that supports us, blah blah blah :)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I tell my students that one of the primary reasons they should contribute is because it makes them more valuable. It builds their skills; it allows them to interact (often) with folks who can teach them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I'm the result of this – I can draw a direct line from my contributions in event organization, code, and other areas to my success today. Contributing back can be difficult, but as long as you look at it as a learning process and that you're going to be smarter on the other side, it's easy to see why it is so valuable. I find it confounding that some organizations don't provide paid time for their Drupal developers to contribute back in some way – it just seems so short-sighted.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As someone who advises developers on what to look for in potential employers, I always stress the importance of personal contribution time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. How have you seen contributions in the Drupal community evolve over the years?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Outside of the ongoing technical changes to code contributions (CVS to Git, bespoke to GitLab, etc…), the single most important evolution continues to be the surfacing of non-code contributions. I think it would be impossible to sustain a healthy open source community over a long period of time without folks who contribute in non-code ways. Event organizers, documentation writers, issue queue cat-herders (is there a better term?), project managers – it's crazy to think that Drupal would be anywhere near as successful as it is today without folks in those roles. We need to celebrate that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Are there any potential challenges with contributing, especially now in the Covid era?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I think on-boarding new contributors will always be easier in-person. Personal connections, away from work/life distractions, localized energy – all things that make on-boarding much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don't think anyone will argue that one continuing challenge is to keep new contributors engaged – I think one potential solution to this is some type of organized mentor program. I'm not sure what it would look like, but having a personal connection is a powerful motivator.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. What are your thoughts on the current contribution credit system in Drupal? Would you say it’s fairly streamlined or are there still improvements to be made?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Heh – as a Drupal developer, I would say that there are always improvements to make. Nothing is ever done. Staying with my theme, I think there's still plenty of room to improve in capturing non-code contributions. For code contributions, I'd love for there to be a way to capture different levels of effort. Someone working for 14 hours on a nasty PHP bug should get more credit than someone fixing a typo in a code comment.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. What are the best non-code ways to contribute to Drupal and other open-source projects?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Depends where your passion lies. If you're a people person, then help with event organizing. If you're more comfortable behind a keyboard, then find an issue queue where you are comfortable reproducing issues, asking questions, and gathering information. I think for folks new to the community, learning about all the potential contribution areas is challenging.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Again, this is where an on-going community mentoring program would help out immensely. Imagine someone helping a new contributor finding a comfortable place for them to contribute to and guiding them for a few months as they get comfortable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. What are some of the projects and initiatives in Drupal which currently need the most contribution help and you would advise our readers to check out and get involved with?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Core initiatives are the easy answer, so I'll move past those and mention (again) local event organization, issue queue triage for modules and themes that you're comfortable with, and mentoring.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. To you, what’s the most exciting thing about contributing to Drupal in 2022?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel like there's a theme here – it's that there are so many ways to contribute, many of them not involving code. If we, as a community, can figure out a way to promote the fact that you don't need to write code to contribute, then harness those potential contributors (using mentors), then we'll be able to accelerate the growth of our community. The potential is really high, we just need to figure out how to access it!</p>\r\n",

          "value": "<p>One of the best parts about an open-source project is the community and the ability to get actively involved in it, working on things you’re either interested in, use for your job and/or would like to lend a hand in moving forward.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, since open-source projects have open-source software at their core, you can only contribute to it by contributing software – i.e. writing code, correct? You probably can’t really contribute in any meaningful way if you don’t code, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, no. It’s not just that <a href=\"https://noti.st/johnpicozzi/KLarOU/non-code-contribution-using-your-passion-and-skills-to-power-open-source\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Notist: Non-Code Contribution: Using your passion and skills to power open source (John Picozzi)\">non-code contribution</a> is welcome, it’s actually very much desired and appreciated – because, contrary to some popular beliefs, the success of an open-source project depends on much more than simply the (admittedly essential) software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Especially for large projects such as WordPress or <a href=\"/drupal\" title=\"Agiledrop: Drupal development\">Drupal</a>, with thriving and vibrant communities, there’s so much more to all the ongoing development than simply regular code updates and plugin/module development. If you’re willing to contribute, it’s a guarantee that you’ll find a way to do so, with help from the kind community members.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, how can you contribute without having coding expertise? Here are 9 ways in which you can help out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>1. Editing/enhancing documentation</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Good documentation is a vital component of a successful open-source project, but, somewhat paradoxically, writing documentation is often one of the most tedious parts of a developer’s workflow, which on top of that requires a completely different set of skills than those needed to actually develop the software which the documentation is intended for, which can result in the documentation not living up to its purpose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By going through the documentation as someone who the (piece of) software is intended for, rather than its creator, you may be able to provide invaluable insights into its shortcomings, clarify certain difficult to understand sections, and/or spot and edit out typos and other errors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>2. Website copy &amp; design</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the progress of open-source projects relies heavily on community members willing to dedicate their own time to work on issues and new features, much less contribution time and effort is naturally spent on areas less directly related to the software, such as marketing optimizations to the software project’s website.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, as with writing documentation, tasks such as design and copy optimizations tend to require different skills than those needed for building the software, and it is hence here where additional help is often needed and appreciated, especially around new major releases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>3. Providing first-hand feedback in your area of expertise</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Beside more direct contribution, it’s also very likely your fresh perspective will be welcome and will end up benefiting the project, either more specifically due to your lack of entrenched knowledge of its inner workings or just more generally as a different, less go-to type of stakeholder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you’re an end-user of the open-source software you’d like to contribute to, one great way to do so is providing first-hand usability feedback and suggestions for improvements from the perspective of this particular user group; so, for example, giving concrete feedback on the admin UX of a CMS as a content editor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>4. Promoting the technology</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>What good is excellent/top-notch software if no one knows about it? In addition to being robust and &nbsp;up-to-date, a successful software project also requires strong marketing supported by well-crafted promotional materials, which is often not a guarantee with open-source software.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Case studies are one of the most valued types of promotional materials, so you can contribute immensely by producing case studies highlighting the key features of the open-source software project to showcase on its website. Alternatively, you can also do a lot just by spreading the word about a project through blog posts, podcasts, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>5. Organizing and hosting events</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most effective ways to promote a particular technology is to organize events around it, either community get-togethers for long-time community members or learning-oriented events intended for newcomers and more recent enthusiasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These can range from large conferences, which typically require a combination of efforts, to mid-sized community-oriented meetups, and to even smaller, more condensed workshops and seminars (for example, Agiledrop frequently organizes Drupal courses for beginners wanting to learn Drupal, and we’ll be launching our first PHP masterclass course next week).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>6. Volunteering at events</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Speaking of events – due to the free nature of OSS, pretty much every open-source event will to some extent rely on volunteer work, even more so now with in-person conferences finally back in action.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this you don’t even need to be super skilled in areas such as design or project management; any kind of help will be welcome and appreciated. Coordinate, help prepare the venue and/or the goodie bags, help with food preparation/distribution, help clean up, help (mentor) other contributors, etc. – anything goes.</p>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"7460c038-3f86-43e9-8117-4ce1d9eb7cab\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>7. Project management</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/nicxvan\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nic Laflin drupal.org\">Nic Laflin</a> points out on an <a href=\"https://www.talkingdrupal.com/346\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Talking Drupal #346 - Open Source Compensation\">episode of the Talking Drupal podcast about open-source compensation</a>, project management is also one area in which developers are often lacking and where help is hence very much needed and welcome.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is especially relevant when there are several people co-contributing to the same project, such as when working on a certain key initiative and/or a contribution sprint at an event, where good coordination can drastically streamline the work and its efficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>8. Sponsorship</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>We already mentioned the free nature of open source under point 6; in recent years of upheaval, this has been a somewhat greater issue than previously due to the escalated stress and disruptions to not only people’s work-life balance but in fact the very ways of living themselves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In times like these, financial sponsorship becomes crucial for the ongoing development of the project. You can sponsor an official organization related to the project you’d like to support, which will empower people working on the core features, or more directly sponsor an individual contributor for their important work (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.jrockowitz.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jacob Rockowitz homepage\">Jacob Rockowitz</a> for his work on the Drupal Webform module).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>9. Specific (one-time) initiatives &amp; projects</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, there are often specific initiatives and (one-time) projects that you can join and contribute to. These can include and overlap with all of the points we’ve already discussed, such as creating promotional materials or helping at an event, but can also mean participating on smaller, short-term projects which are part of a broader initiative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Join a team (very often you’ll be able to find their dedicated Slack/Discord channel as a great starting point) that’s most suitable for you with regards to your interests and expertise. This way you’ll stay in the loop about opportunities to contribute, and sooner or later, you will get your chance to contribute in a unique way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Some common concerns that might be holding you back – and how to get rid of them</h2>\r\n\r\n<h3>What if I’m not familiar with the community’s preferred workflows and tools?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It’s in fact very unlikely you will be familiar with the standard workflows and tooling if this is your first time contributing (even as a developer, to some extent). Don’t worry too much about it and just do your best to showcase your readiness to help out and willingness to learn, your teammates and other community members will be happy to help you.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What if I’m not experienced enough or have imposter syndrome?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>What does it even mean to be “experienced enough”? It’s not like there’s a bar determining whether you can contribute or not. If you feel like you lack experience, start with simpler tasks/issues and move your way up from there. Plus, it may very well be the case of quality over quantity if you’re bringing unique skills to the table.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What if no one appreciates my suggestions/ideas?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be tough receiving negative <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/give-effective-feedback-remotely/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Smashing Magazine: How To Give Effective Feedback Remotely\">feedback</a> if you’re new to something and eager to help out. Fortunately, <a href=\"/blog/power-open-source-communities\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: The power of open-source communities\">open-source communities</a> are often very welcoming and friendly, with members being appreciative of new contributors willing to help out; rather than outright rejecting your ideas, they will likely approach this in a more understanding and constructive manner, enabling you to still learn the most from it.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What if I’m not communicative or extroverted?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You’ll most often be collaborating remotely and asynchronously anyway, which won’t in any way be hampered by your potential introversion. Even in cases where collaboration takes place during video meetings, you can participate by taking meeting notes and/or just listening intently to have a better grasp of what work still needs to be done.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>What if my English isn’t good enough, or I have a heavy accent, and other community members will have trouble understanding me?</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Language should definitely not be a barrier if you have a desire to contribute. Keep in mind that it’s very likely other contributors will also be non-native English speakers and may be having similar hesitations about their communication. On top of that, the more you <em>do</em> communicate, the better your English will get, and the easier it will become to engage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Why contribute?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, let’s explore a little bit more about the benefits of contributing to an open-source project and reasons why you should get involved in one.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li><strong>Learning:</strong> not only will you learn a ton of new hard skills, you’ll benefit even more from all the soft skills you’ll acquire through collaborating and solving problems together with a diverse and friendly community.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Connecting:</strong> in the Drupal community, there’s a saying: “<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/community\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Community\">Come for the code, stay for the community.</a>” And, indeed, one of the indisputably best things about being an active part of an open-source community is all the connections and friendships that you forge, which is pretty much an irreplaceable experience.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Visibility &amp; reputation:</strong> being an active contributor will also help you distinguish yourself, gain visibility and build a reputation, either for your employer, for yourself individually, or most likely both.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>New/fresh perspective:</strong> we’ve already talked about the value an outside view can bring, and we’re bringing it up again as a more altruistic reason to get involved, as it’s aimed not toward your own personal growth, but the goals and interests of the software project.</li>\r\n\t<li><strong>Play your part in software used by people across the world:</strong> finally, this one connects the personal with the altruistic reasons for contributing. Knowing that you contributed to a software product that’s benefiting the lives of people you have never and will never meet is one of the most powerful drives for getting involved.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<drupal-media data-align=\"center\" data-entity-type=\"media\" data-entity-uuid=\"ce4e524e-d9bb-4fde-b234-195e929d811b\" data-view-mode=\"medium_800\"></drupal-media>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Don’t let your lack of development expertise stop you from contributing to open source. Projects always need diverse skills and people for sustainable success, and you’re the only one who will be able to bring <em><strong>your</strong></em> skills and insights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We hope this article was able to alleviate some of the hesitations around getting involved in open source projects and provide some motivation to get started more easily. There are a lot of ways to contribute. Just get in touch with a member or lead of the team you believe could benefit from your input and they’ll happily help guide you from there.</p>\r\n",

          "processed": "<p>One of the best parts about an open-source project is the community and the ability to get actively involved in it, working on things you’re either interested in, use for your job and/or would like to lend a hand in moving forward.</p>\n\n<p>But, since open-source projects have open-source software at their core, you can only contribute to it by contributing software – i.e. writing code, correct? You probably can’t really contribute in any meaningful way if you don’t code, right?</p>\n\n<p>Well, no. It’s not just that <a href=\"https://noti.st/johnpicozzi/KLarOU/non-code-contribution-using-your-passion-and-skills-to-power-open-source\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Notist: Non-Code Contribution: Using your passion and skills to power open source (John Picozzi)\">non-code contribution</a> is welcome, it’s actually very much desired and appreciated – because, contrary to some popular beliefs, the success of an open-source project depends on much more than simply the (admittedly essential) software.</p>\n\n<p>Especially for large projects such as WordPress or <a href=\"/drupal\" title=\"Agiledrop: Drupal development\">Drupal</a>, with thriving and vibrant communities, there’s so much more to all the ongoing development than simply regular code updates and plugin/module development. If you’re willing to contribute, it’s a guarantee that you’ll find a way to do so, with help from the kind community members.</p>\n\n<p>So, how can you contribute without having coding expertise? Here are 9 ways in which you can help out.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>1. Editing/enhancing documentation</h2>\n\n<p>Good documentation is a vital component of a successful open-source project, but, somewhat paradoxically, writing documentation is often one of the most tedious parts of a developer’s workflow, which on top of that requires a completely different set of skills than those needed to actually develop the software which the documentation is intended for, which can result in the documentation not living up to its purpose.</p>\n\n<p>By going through the documentation as someone who the (piece of) software is intended for, rather than its creator, you may be able to provide invaluable insights into its shortcomings, clarify certain difficult to understand sections, and/or spot and edit out typos and other errors.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>2. Website copy &amp; design</h2>\n\n<p>Since the progress of open-source projects relies heavily on community members willing to dedicate their own time to work on issues and new features, much less contribution time and effort is naturally spent on areas less directly related to the software, such as marketing optimizations to the software project’s website.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, as with writing documentation, tasks such as design and copy optimizations tend to require different skills than those needed for building the software, and it is hence here where additional help is often needed and appreciated, especially around new major releases.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>3. Providing first-hand feedback in your area of expertise</h2>\n\n<p>Beside more direct contribution, it’s also very likely your fresh perspective will be welcome and will end up benefiting the project, either more specifically due to your lack of entrenched knowledge of its inner workings or just more generally as a different, less go-to type of stakeholder.</p>\n\n<p>If you’re an end-user of the open-source software you’d like to contribute to, one great way to do so is providing first-hand usability feedback and suggestions for improvements from the perspective of this particular user group; so, for example, giving concrete feedback on the admin UX of a CMS as a content editor.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>4. Promoting the technology</h2>\n\n<p>What good is excellent/top-notch software if no one knows about it? In addition to being robust and  up-to-date, a successful software project also requires strong marketing supported by well-crafted promotional materials, which is often not a guarantee with open-source software.</p>\n\n<p>Case studies are one of the most valued types of promotional materials, so you can contribute immensely by producing case studies highlighting the key features of the open-source software project to showcase on its website. Alternatively, you can also do a lot just by spreading the word about a project through blog posts, podcasts, etc.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>5. Organizing and hosting events</h2>\n\n<p>One of the most effective ways to promote a particular technology is to organize events around it, either community get-togethers for long-time community members or learning-oriented events intended for newcomers and more recent enthusiasts.</p>\n\n<p>These can range from large conferences, which typically require a combination of efforts, to mid-sized community-oriented meetups, and to even smaller, more condensed workshops and seminars (for example, Agiledrop frequently organizes Drupal courses for beginners wanting to learn Drupal, and we’ll be launching our first PHP masterclass course next week).</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>6. Volunteering at events</h2>\n\n<p>Speaking of events – due to the free nature of OSS, pretty much every open-source event will to some extent rely on volunteer work, even more so now with in-person conferences finally back in action.</p>\n\n<p>For this you don’t even need to be super skilled in areas such as design or project management; any kind of help will be welcome and appreciated. Coordinate, help prepare the venue and/or the goodie bags, help with food preparation/distribution, help clean up, help (mentor) other contributors, etc. – anything goes.</p>\n\n<article data-align=\"center\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/medium_800/public/2022-05/IMG_1400%20%281%29.jpeg?itok=WS6Yfl2S\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" alt=\"Iztok standing next to coffee stand sponsored by Agiledrop at DCEU Vienna 2017\" loading=\"lazy\" /></article><p> </p>\n\n<h2>7. Project management</h2>\n\n<p>As <a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/u/nicxvan\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Nic Laflin drupal.org\">Nic Laflin</a> points out on an <a href=\"https://www.talkingdrupal.com/346\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Talking Drupal #346 - Open Source Compensation\">episode of the Talking Drupal podcast about open-source compensation</a>, project management is also one area in which developers are often lacking and where help is hence very much needed and welcome. </p>\n\n<p>This is especially relevant when there are several people co-contributing to the same project, such as when working on a certain key initiative and/or a contribution sprint at an event, where good coordination can drastically streamline the work and its efficiency.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>8. Sponsorship</h2>\n\n<p>We already mentioned the free nature of open source under point 6; in recent years of upheaval, this has been a somewhat greater issue than previously due to the escalated stress and disruptions to not only people’s work-life balance but in fact the very ways of living themselves.</p>\n\n<p>In times like these, financial sponsorship becomes crucial for the ongoing development of the project. You can sponsor an official organization related to the project you’d like to support, which will empower people working on the core features, or more directly sponsor an individual contributor for their important work (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.jrockowitz.com\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Jacob Rockowitz homepage\">Jacob Rockowitz</a> for his work on the Drupal Webform module).</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>9. Specific (one-time) initiatives &amp; projects</h2>\n\n<p>Lastly, there are often specific initiatives and (one-time) projects that you can join and contribute to. These can include and overlap with all of the points we’ve already discussed, such as creating promotional materials or helping at an event, but can also mean participating on smaller, short-term projects which are part of a broader initiative.</p>\n\n<p>Join a team (very often you’ll be able to find their dedicated Slack/Discord channel as a great starting point) that’s most suitable for you with regards to your interests and expertise. This way you’ll stay in the loop about opportunities to contribute, and sooner or later, you will get your chance to contribute in a unique way.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Some common concerns that might be holding you back – and how to get rid of them</h2>\n\n<h3>What if I’m not familiar with the community’s preferred workflows and tools?</h3>\n\n<p>It’s in fact very unlikely you will be familiar with the standard workflows and tooling if this is your first time contributing (even as a developer, to some extent). Don’t worry too much about it and just do your best to showcase your readiness to help out and willingness to learn, your teammates and other community members will be happy to help you.</p>\n\n<h3>What if I’m not experienced enough or have imposter syndrome?</h3>\n\n<p>What does it even mean to be “experienced enough”? It’s not like there’s a bar determining whether you can contribute or not. If you feel like you lack experience, start with simpler tasks/issues and move your way up from there. Plus, it may very well be the case of quality over quantity if you’re bringing unique skills to the table.</p>\n\n<h3>What if no one appreciates my suggestions/ideas?</h3>\n\n<p>It can be tough receiving negative <a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/05/give-effective-feedback-remotely/\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Smashing Magazine: How To Give Effective Feedback Remotely\">feedback</a> if you’re new to something and eager to help out. Fortunately, <a href=\"/blog/power-open-source-communities\" title=\"Agiledrop blog: The power of open-source communities\">open-source communities</a> are often very welcoming and friendly, with members being appreciative of new contributors willing to help out; rather than outright rejecting your ideas, they will likely approach this in a more understanding and constructive manner, enabling you to still learn the most from it.</p>\n\n<h3>What if I’m not communicative or extroverted?</h3>\n\n<p>You’ll most often be collaborating remotely and asynchronously anyway, which won’t in any way be hampered by your potential introversion. Even in cases where collaboration takes place during video meetings, you can participate by taking meeting notes and/or just listening intently to have a better grasp of what work still needs to be done.</p>\n\n<h3>What if my English isn’t good enough, or I have a heavy accent, and other community members will have trouble understanding me?</h3>\n\n<p>Language should definitely not be a barrier if you have a desire to contribute. Keep in mind that it’s very likely other contributors will also be non-native English speakers and may be having similar hesitations about their communication. On top of that, the more you <em>do</em> communicate, the better your English will get, and the easier it will become to engage.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n\n<h2>Why contribute?</h2>\n\n<p>Finally, let’s explore a little bit more about the benefits of contributing to an open-source project and reasons why you should get involved in one.</p>\n\n<ul><li><strong>Learning:</strong> not only will you learn a ton of new hard skills, you’ll benefit even more from all the soft skills you’ll acquire through collaborating and solving problems together with a diverse and friendly community.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Connecting:</strong> in the Drupal community, there’s a saying: “<a href=\"https://www.drupal.org/community\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Drupal.org: Community\">Come for the code, stay for the community.</a>” And, indeed, one of the indisputably best things about being an active part of an open-source community is all the connections and friendships that you forge, which is pretty much an irreplaceable experience.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Visibility &amp; reputation:</strong> being an active contributor will also help you distinguish yourself, gain visibility and build a reputation, either for your employer, for yourself individually, or most likely both.</li>\n\t<li><strong>New/fresh perspective:</strong> we’ve already talked about the value an outside view can bring, and we’re bringing it up again as a more altruistic reason to get involved, as it’s aimed not toward your own personal growth, but the goals and interests of the software project.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Play your part in software used by people across the world:</strong> finally, this one connects the personal with the altruistic reasons for contributing. Knowing that you contributed to a software product that’s benefiting the lives of people you have never and will never meet is one of the most powerful drives for getting involved.</li>\n</ul><article data-align=\"center\"><img src=\"/sites/default/files/styles/medium_800/public/2022-05/wceu-2020-family-photo-322-original-1920px.jpeg?itok=hOSpf0-z\" width=\"800\" height=\"690\" alt=\"WordCamp Europe 2020 family photo\" loading=\"lazy\" /></article><p> </p>\n\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n\n<p>Don’t let your lack of development expertise stop you from contributing to open source. Projects always need diverse skills and people for sustainable success, and you’re the only one who will be able to bring <em><strong>your</strong></em> skills and insights.</p>\n\n<p>We hope this article was able to alleviate some of the hesitations around getting involved in open source projects and provide some motivation to get started more easily. There are a lot of ways to contribute. Just get in touch with a member or lead of the team you believe could benefit from your input and they’ll happily help guide you from there.</p>\n",
